    "The <b>Magnet Sphere</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>magic weapon</linked> that casts a glowing, slow-moving cyan sphere, which travels in a straight line, unimpeded by <linked>liquids</linked> or other non-solid obstacles in its path and <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span> can bounce off tiles. The sphere will rapidly shoot instantaneous, non-piercing beams at the closest <linked>enemy</linked> as it travels through the air, and disappears if it has been in the air for more than 15 <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span> / 11 <span class=\"eico i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Old-gen console and 3DS versions)</span></span> seconds or has traveled 52 tiles. If the player casts another sphere while there is already one in the air, the previous one will fade away. The Magnet Sphere has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"0.33\">1/300 (0.33%)</span> / <linked>599/90000 (0.67%)</linked> chance of being dropped by <linked>Blue Armored Bones</linked>, <linked>Rusty Armored Bones</linked>, and <linked>Hell Armored Bones</linked> in the post-Plantera <linked>Dungeon</linked>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The <b>Mythical</b> modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but the only stats that improve damage output are damage and critical chance. Switching to a different magic weapon causes existing projectiles to use that weapon's critical chance instead, meaning that the Magnet Sphere's <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr> is optimized with the Ruthless modifier when used in the intended way."
