    "The <b>Magnet Sphere</b> is a Hardmode, post-Plantera magic weapon that casts a glowing sphere where the player aims. It has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.33*</s>1/300 (0.33%)</span> / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\"><span class=\"chance\"><s>0.67*</s>1/150 (0.67%)</span></abbr> chance to be obtained from the Blue Armored Bones, Rusty Armored Bones and Hell Armored Bones in the post-Plantera Dungeon.",
    "When cast, it fires a slow cyan sphere that travels in a straight line and zaps nearby enemies, unimpeded by liquid or other non-solid obstacles in its path and <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> can bounce off tiles. The sphere will rapidly shoot beams at the closest enemy as it travels through the air. It will disappear if it has been in the air for more than 15 <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / 11 <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> seconds or has gone 52 tiles. If the player casts another sphere while there is already one in the air, the previous one will fade away.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The <b>Mythical</b> modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but the only stats that improve damage output are damage and critical chance. Switching to a different magic weapon causes existing projectiles to use that weapon's critical chance instead, meaning that the Magnet Sphere's <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr> is optimized with the Ruthless modifier when used in the intended way."
