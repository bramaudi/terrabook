    "The <b>Magnet Sphere</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>magic weapon</linked> that casts a glowing sphere where the player aims.

    "When cast, it fires a slow cyan sphere that travels in a straight line and zaps nearby enemies, unimpeded by <linked>liquid</linked> or other non-solid obstacles in its path and <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span> can bounce off tiles.

    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The <b>Mythical</b> modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but the only stats that improve damage output are damage and critical chance. Switching to a different magic weapon causes existing projectiles to use that weapon's critical chance instead, meaning that the Magnet Sphere's <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr> is optimized with the Ruthless modifier when used in the intended way."
