    "The <b>Magnet Sphere</b> is a Hardmode, post-Plantera magic weapon that casts a glowing sphere where the player aims. It has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.33*</s>1/300 (0.33%)</span> / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\"><span class=\"chance\"><s>0.67*</s>1/150 (0.67%)</span></abbr> chance to be obtained from the Blue Armored Bones, Rusty Armored Bones and Hell Armored Bones in the post-Plantera Dungeon.",
    "When cast, it fires a slow cyan sphere that travels in a straight line and zaps nearby enemies, unimpeded by liquid or other non-solid obstacles in its path. The sphere will rapidly shoot beams at the closest enemy as it travels through the air. It will disappear if the central orb hits a solid object, has gone 52 tiles, or if it has been in the air for 7 seconds. If the player casts another sphere while there is already one in the air, the previous one will fade away.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The <b>Mythical</b> modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but the only stats that improve damage output are damage and critical chance. Switching to a different magic weapon causes existing projectiles to use that weapon's critical chance instead, meaning that the Magnet Sphere's <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr> is optimized with the Ruthless modifier when used in the intended way."
