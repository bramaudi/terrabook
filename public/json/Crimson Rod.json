    "The <b>Crimson Rod</b> is a magic weapon that launches a reddish rain cloud towards the cursor, where it rains damaging blood droplets downward onto enemies below. The cloud projectile does not pass through terrain, instead stopping if it hits a surface before it reaches its target location. As well, its coverage area is rather narrow, making it difficult to use in open areas or against agile foes. The droplets can pierce one enemy, dissipating upon hitting a second one or a solid block. They also dissipate after falling for around 20 tiles.",
    "The Crimson Rod can be obtained by destroying Crimson Hearts found in the Crimson or from <span class=\"eil\"><span>Crimson Crates</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> and <span class=\"eil\"><span>Hematic Crates</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>, which are fished in the Crimson.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Demonic</b> or <b>Deadly</b> for damage output, or <b>Mystic</b> for mana conservation because it cannot get modifiers that affect knockback.  Note that with the Rod's sentry-like summon pattern, mana usage is unlikely to be an issue, and that boosts to speed only affect how quickly the cloud can be resummoned, not how quickly the cloud produces rain."
