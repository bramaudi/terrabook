    "The <b>Diabolist</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>enemy</linked> that spawns in the <linked>Dungeon</linked> after Plantera is defeated. Diabolists attack by firing blazing magic bolts that can travel through <linked>blocks</linked> at the player. These bolts explode, creating a large flaming sphere that lasts for 3.83 seconds and deals massive damage on contact. Both the bolts and the spheres inflict the <linked>On Fire!</linked> <linked>debuff</linked> for 8–15 / <linked>16–30</linked> / <linked>20–37.5</linked> seconds. Diabolists teleport to a different location on-screen after firing six projectiles or upon being hit.",
