    "The <b>Chlorophyte Extractinator</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>mechanical bosses</linked> upgrade to the <linked>Extractinator</linked>. It is an item that converts <linked>Silt</linked>, <linked>Slush</linked>, and <linked>Desert Fossils</linked> into more valuable items such as <linked>ores</linked>, <linked>coins</linked>, and <linked>gems</linked>, as well as fishing trash into low level bait. The Chlorophyte Extractinator converts items faster, and can produce <linked>Hardmode ores</linked>; it can also exchange <linked>Glowing Mosses</linked> into all kinds of mosses (except <linked>Helium Moss</linked>), instead of only regular ones.",
    "It can also turn the <linked>Corruption</linked>, <linked>Crimson</linked>, and <linked>Hallow</linked> variants of most blocks into their normal variants. Alongside this, it can also be used to convert ores/bars into their alternate ore types (such as <linked>Tin</linked> being converted into <linked>Copper</linked>), and <linked>Dungeon Bricks</linked> into their variants.",
    "To use the Chlorophyte Extractinator, it first needs to be <linked>placed</linked> in the world. Afterward, suitable blocks need to be consumed (with the <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚒ Use / Attack</linked></span> key) directly on the Chlorophyte Extractinator within its 3×3 frame. Holding the <span class=\"key\"><linked>Auto Select</linked></span> key and clicking on the Chlorophyte Extractinator will automatically insert extractable items from the player's inventory without having to pick them up manually."
