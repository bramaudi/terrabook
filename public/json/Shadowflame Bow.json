    "The <b>Shadowflame Bow</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>bow</linked> that converts any type of <linked>arrow</linked> into special Shadowflame Arrows, which pierce up to two <linked>enemies</linked> before dissipating on the third hit while also inflicting the <linked>Shadowflame</linked> <linked>debuff</linked> for 2â€“5 seconds. Shadowflame Arrows fly relatively slowly, but have an extremely high arc compared to most arrows, and may seem at first to be unaffected by <linked>gravity</linked> at all. If fired directly upwards, Shadowflame Arrows can travel 250 tiles skyward before beginning their descent, taking approximately 12 seconds from firing to fall back down to the player's position. The Shadowflame Bow also has a base 7% <linked>critical strike chance</linked> as opposed to the usual 4%.",
