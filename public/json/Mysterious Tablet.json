    "The <b>Mysterious Tablet</b> is a <linked>background object</linked> which spawns at the entrance to the <linked>Dungeon</linked> after <linked>Golem</linked> is defeated. Players cannot interact with it in any way, as it serves only as a graphical prop for the <linked>Cultists</linked>' ritual and the spawning of the <linked>Lunatic Cultist</linked> <linked>boss</linked>.",
    "The Mysterious Tablet spawns surrounded by four initially passive Cultists, two of them being <linked>Lunatic Devotees</linked> and the others being <linked>Blue Cultist Archers</linked>. Once all four Cultists are killed, the Lunatic Cultist spawns, destroying the Tablet and starting the boss fight.",
    "The Mysterious Tablet will respawn (including the Cultists) after 12 minutes (12 in-game hours), if the player runs away or <linked>dies</linked> during the Lunatic Cultist fight, when all four <linked>Celestial Pillars</linked> are destroyed, or when the world is closed and restarted. Restarting the world can be the fastest option to reset the Tablet and the Cultists to their original state."
