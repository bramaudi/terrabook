{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Mysterious Tablet","summaries":["The <b>Mysterious Tablet</b> is a background object which spawns at the entrance to the Dungeon after Golem is defeated. Players cannot interact with it in any way, as it serves only as a graphical prop for the Cultists' ritual and the spawning of the Lunatic Cultist boss.","The Mysterious Tablet spawns surrounded by four initially passive Cultists, two of them being Lunatic Devotees and the others being Blue Cultist Archers. Once all four Cultists are killed, the Lunatic Cultist spawns, destroying the Tablet, and starting the boss fight.","The Mysterious Tablet will respawn (including the Cultists) after one in-game day, if the player runs away or dies during the Lunatic Cultist fight, when all four Celestial Pillars are destroyed, or when the world is closed and restarted. Restarting the world can be the fastest option to reset the Tablet and the Cultists to their original state."],"statistics":{"Environment":"<div class=\"tags\"><span class=\"tag\"> Dungeon entrance </span></div>","AI Type":"Lunatic Devotee AI","Damage":"<span class=\"npcstat\"><span class=\"m-all\">0</span></span>","Max Life":"<span class=\"npcstat\"><span class=\"m-all\">400</span></span>","Defense":"<span class=\"npcstat\"><span class=\"m-all\">0</span></span>","KB Resist":"<span class=\"npcstat\"><span class=\"m-all\">100%</span></span>","Immune to":"<b>All debuffs</b>"},"crafts":{}}
