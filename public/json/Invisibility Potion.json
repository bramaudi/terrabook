    "An <b>Invisibility Potion</b> is a buff potion that grants the <b>Invisibility</b> buff when consumed, which turns the player invisible. This lasts for <span class=\"etxt\"><span>3 minutes</span><span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> / <span class=\"etxt\"><span>2 minutes</span><span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>, but can be canceled at any time  by right-clicking the icon ([img:Desktop version] [img:Legacy tModLoader version]),  by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu ([img:Console version] [img:Old-gen console version]),  by double-tapping the buff icon ([img:Mobile version]), or  by canceling the buff from the buffs screen ([img:Nintendo 3DS version]).",
    "<span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> Using an Invisibility Potion conceals the player entirely, including their armor and vanity items, as well as the player's mount. While hidden, the player's Aggro statistic is reduced, meaning enemies will be less likely to target the player and they will not fire ranged attacks as long the player remains hidden. Attacking while under the stealth effect will cause the player to reappear temporarily, and the buff will be cancelled entirely if the player takes damage. Placing or breaking blocks will also cause the player to reappear. The player's head will still be visible on the minimap to non-hostile players in multiplayer. <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> Using the potion also reduces enemy spawn rates by 20%.",
    "<span class=\"eico i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> Using the Invisibility Potion will cause the player's sprite to turn invisible, though accessories and armor will remain visible. A player in default clothing, either through unequipping all items or through use of the Familiar set, will become totally invisible. This has no effect on enemies, but an opposing player in PvP will not be able to see an invisible player with no visible items equipped. However, competing PvP players still see an invisible player's name tag.",
    "Invisibility will never hide any lighting or particle effects from armor and other items. For example, the smoke effects from sprinting accessories, and beetles from Beetle armor, will still display. Minions, pets and light pets will also remain visible."
