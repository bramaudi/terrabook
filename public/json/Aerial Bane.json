    "The <b>Aerial Bane</b> is a Hardmode, post-Golem bow which is dropped by Betsy during the Old One's Army event. It converts any type of arrow into six special arrows every time the bow is fired. The special arrows deal 150% base damage (58 base damage) to airborne enemies. <span class=\"eico i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span> The listed damage in the tooltip is the damage against airborne enemies.",
    "The special arrows drop off sharply and will disappear in midair if they fall enough distance. Upon hitting an enemy, an arrow splits into five, angled downward in a symmetrical 90-degree spread with the center arrow firing straight downward, regardless of what angle the enemy was hit at. These five new arrows will not split again when they hit an enemy.",
