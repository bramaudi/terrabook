    "The <b>Soaring Insignia</b> is a Hardmode accessory obtained from the Empress of Light's Treasure Bag. It grants increased jump height and flight ascent speed, similarly to the Frog Leg. It also grants unlimited flight time with wings or Rocket Boots, and greatly increases the player's acceleration when flying, running (+<abbr title=\"2 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 1.47 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">2 mph</span></abbr>), or falling; the player will reach maximum speed much more easily, and will be able to stop, change directions and go from flying upwards to falling or vice versa very quickly."
