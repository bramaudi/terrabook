    "The <b>Glow Tulip</b> is a <linked>pet-summoning</linked> item that spawns a <b>Caveling Gardener</b> to follow the player around. When the player is far enough away or in midair, it flies through solid tiles while holding onto a <linked>Snare Plant</linked> in order to catch up to them. The Glow Tulip can be found rarely near the left and right edges of the world below the <linked>Surface</linked> as a <linked>plant</linked>. Depending on <linked>world size</linked>, a set amount of Glow Tulips will spawn during world generation: 2 in small worlds, 4 in medium worlds, and 6 in large worlds. Half of them are usually generated on the left side and the other half on the right side of the world.",
