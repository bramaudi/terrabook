    "<b>Smoke Blocks</b> are animated background furniture blocks that can be purchased from the Party Girl for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Silver Coin\" data-sort-value=\"100\"><span class=\"sc\">1</span></span> in Hardmode. When placed together, they will connect in a way that each block on the outer left and right sides visually take up half of a block. For example, if a player were to make a 3×3 arrangement of Smoke Blocks, the entire left and right columns of smoke will appear to be halved, resulting in a slimmer appearance."
