    "<b>Thrown Water</b> refers to a set of three <linked>consumable</linked> <linked>weapons</linked> that each convert a small area into a biome (<linked>Hallow</linked>, <linked>Corruption</linked>, or <linked>Crimson</linked> for <b>Holy Water</b>, <b>Unholy Water</b>, and <b>Blood Water</b> respectively) when thrown.
