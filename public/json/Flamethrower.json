    "The <b>Flamethrower</b> is a Hardmode ranged weapon that uses Gel for ammunition. Every press of the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Left Click (PC default): Use held item or attack\">âš’ Use / Attack</span></kbd></span> button consumes one Gel and generates five bursts of fire in quick succession that can be spread over an area by moving the mouse while firing. With some modifiers that increase firing speed (e.g. Unreal and Rapid), each attack consumes two Gel and fires six bursts.",
    "On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, the Flamethrower's fire bursts have unique graphics, and fly out of the weapon at a high velocity while expanding with time, before disappearing a short distance ahead of the player, creating a cone-like area of effect. The fire has 15 armor penetration, inflicts the Hellfire debuff for 20 seconds, and can pierce through three enemies before dissipating upon hitting a fourth. Additionally, the projectile's damage decreases by 15% for each enemy it pierces.",
    "On the [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console version, Nintendo 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version] version, and [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader version, the flamethrower's bursts are straight lines of fire particles, which travel out from the weapon to a short distance ahead of the player before stopping, lingering briefly. The fire inflicts the On Fire! debuff for 20 seconds, and can pierce through three enemies before dissipating upon hitting a fourth.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Unreal</b>."
