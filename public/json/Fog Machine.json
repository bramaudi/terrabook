    "The <b>Fog Machine</b> is a placed novelty <linked>mechanism</linked> that produces a fog cloud around it. It can be activated and deactivated via <linked>wire</linked>, but is always on by default when first placed. The fog is purely visual, has no functional effect, and can be produced infinitely at no cost. When Fog Machines are placed next to each other and are active, the fog gets thicker which makes it harder to see through. The Fog Machine is purchased from the <linked>Party Girl</linked> for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"4 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"40000\"><span class=\"gc\">4</span></span> at night."
