    "The <b>Deadly Sphere Staff</b> is a Hardmode, post-Plantera summoning weapon that summons a Deadly Sphere minion. Like other minions, the summoned Deadly Sphere is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. It attacks by charging at enemies to inflict contact damage. It cannot move through blocks. The Deadly Sphere Staff has a 2.5% / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\">4.94%</abbr> (1/40 / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\">79/1600</abbr>) chance to drop from Deadly Sphere during a Solar Eclipse.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Deadly Sphere Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback."
