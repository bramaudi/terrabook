{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Void Bag","summaries":["The <b>Void Bag</b> is a <linked>portable storage</linked> item that grants the player access to the <linked>Void Vault</linked> at anywhere. Pressing <span class=\"key\"><linked>âš· Open / Activate</linked></span> on the Void Bag item in the inventory will toggle it between \"opened\" Void Bag and <b>Closed Void Bag</b>. When used, it will provide a temporary portal, providing access to the player's Void Vault that lasts for 3 minutes. The item is not consumed and can be used limitlessly.","When opened, the Void Vault storage will effectively act as the player's secondary inventory, which automatically stores items collected after the player's main inventory is full, indicated by purple pickup text. Additionally, it also allows the player to interact with the items inside it as if they were in the main inventory without opening the Void Vault storage interface.","When closed, the Void Bag functions similarly to the <linked>Money Trough</linked>, only acting as a regular <linked>portable storage</linked> item. This will prevent it from picking up items when the player has a full inventory, and it loses the function of the secondary inventory."],"statistics":{"Use time":"28 <span class=\"usetime\">(Average)</span>","Velocity":"4","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Summons the void vault<br>Functions as an extended inventory when open<br>May pick up overflowing items when open<br>Right click to close<br>'This pocket dimension is out of this world!'</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\"><linked>[img:Rarity level: 3]</linked></span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"2 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"20000\"><span class=\"gc\">2</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{"<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recipes\">Recipes</span>":[{"result":{"rowspan":2,"value":"<span class=\"i multi-line\"><linked>[img:Void Bag]</linked><span><span><linked>Void Bag</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span>"},"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Bone]</linked><span><span><linked>Bone</linked></span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(30)</span></li><li><span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Jungle Spores]</linked><span><span><linked>Jungle Spores</linked></span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(15)</span></li><li><span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Shadow Scale]</linked><span><span><linked>Shadow Scale</linked></span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(30)</span></li></ul>"},"station":{"rowspan":2,"value":"<span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Demon Altar]</linked><span><span><linked>Demon Altar</linked></span></span></span><br><i><b>or</b></i><br><span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Crimson Altar]</linked><span><span><linked>Crimson Altar</linked></span></span></span>"}},{"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Bone]</linked><span><span><linked>Bone</linked></span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(30)</span></li><li><span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Jungle Spores]</linked><span><span><linked>Jungle Spores</linked></span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(15)</span></li><li><span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Tissue Sample]</linked><span><span><linked>Tissue Sample</linked></span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(30)</span></li></ul>"}}]}}
