    "The <b>Brain Suckler</b> is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist flying enemy spawned by the Nebula Pillar during the Lunar Events. It latches onto the player's head, dealing large amounts of damage at a steady rate, while also inflicting the <b>Obstructed</b> debuff for the remainder of time it is on the player. The debuff causes the player's screen to darken significantly, except for a small area around the player, similar to the Blackout debuff. It additionally has the effect of Bleeding, preventing all health regeneration."
