    "The <b>Spider Egg</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>pet</linked>-summoning item that spawns a <b>Pet Spider</b> to follow the player around. The Pet Spider climbs on background <linked>walls</linked> and has similar behavior to the <linked>Spider AI</linked>. When the player is far enough away or in midair, the Pet Spider rides on a white spiderweb, as if it were standing on a wall, to keep up with the player. The Spider Egg is dropped by the <linked>Pumpking</linked> during the <linked>Pumpkin Moon</linked> <linked>event</linked> with a 1.56–12.5% (<linked>6.25–12.5%</linked>) chance depending on the current wave."
