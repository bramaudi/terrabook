    "The <b>Star Cell</b> is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist enemy spawned by the Stardust Pillar during the Lunar Events. It floats slowly towards the player, but can move at a faster rate if the player begins moving away from it.",
    "Upon death, it splits into smaller versions of itself. If these small Star Cells are not dealt with, they will grow into a full-sized Star Cell, that can also split into smaller Star Cells. Small Star Cells do not contribute to the kill count required to break the Stardust Pillar's shield, though after growing back, they do."
