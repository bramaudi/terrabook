    "In addition to providing light, the Suspicious Looking Tentacle senses nearby <linked>NPCs</linked>, <linked>enemies</linked>, treasure (<linked>Pots</linked>, <linked>Chests</linked>, etc.), and <linked>ores</linked> within a 17-tile radius. This is shown via its pupil and iris pointing in the direction of the entity sensed, as well as expanding for treasure and contracting for enemies. The eye will also sparkle when nearby ores and treasures are detected."
