    "The <b>Suspicious Looking Tentacle</b> is a Hardmode light pet summoning item obtained from the Moon Lord's Treasure Bag in Expert Mode. It summons the <b>Suspicious Looking Eye</b>, a small tentacled eye that provides light and follows the player.",
    "In addition to providing light, the Suspicious Looking Tentacle senses nearby NPCs, enemies, treasure (Pots, Chests, etc.), and ores within a 17-tile radius. This is shown via its pupil and iris pointing in the direction of the entity sensed, as well as expanding for treasure and contracting for enemies. The eye will also sparkle when nearby ores and treasure are detected."
