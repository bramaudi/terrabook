    "The <b>Lunar Portal Staff</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Moon Lord</linked> <linked>sentry summon weapon</linked>. It can summon the <b>Lunar Portal</b> <linked>sentry</linked>, which lasts for 10 minutes, remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. When summoned, the Lunar Portal continuously fires beams that sweep across <linked>enemies</linked> within its 60-tile range, piercing through an unlimited number of enemies but unable to pass through tiles. The Lunar Portal Staff has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"22.22\">2/9 (22.22%)</span> chance of being dropped from the <linked>Moon Lord</linked>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal <linked>critical hits</linked>. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Lunar Portal Staff has over a Ruthless one is <linked>knockback</linked>."
