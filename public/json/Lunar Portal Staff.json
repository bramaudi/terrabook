    "The <b>Lunar Portal Staff</b> is a Hardmode, post-Moon Lord sentry summon weapon. It can summon the <b>Lunar Portal</b> sentry, which lasts for <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 10 minutes / <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 2 minutes, remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. The Lunar Portal Staff has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>11.11*</s>1/9 (11.11%)</span> chance of being dropped by the Moon Lord boss.",
    "It fires a continuous beam that sweep across enemies within its 60-tile range.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Lunar Portal Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback."
