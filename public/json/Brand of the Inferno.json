    "While holding the Brand of the Inferno with any equipped shield (excluding the <linked>Huntress's Buckler</linked>), pressing the <span class=\"key\"><linked>âš· Open / Activate</linked></span> button will cause the player to raise the shield and brace for the next attack. When timed correctly, just before taking a hit, the <linked>enemy</linked>'s attack will be parried, which negates the contact damage being dealt to the player, deals 200% of the contact damage of the attacking enemy, inflicts a knockback value of 5 <span>(Average)</span>, and grants the player 30 <linked>invincibility frames</linked> (60 with the <linked>Cross Necklace</linked> equipped). Successfully parrying an attack also grants the <linked>Striking Moment</linked> <linked>buff</linked>, causing the next <linked>melee-based</linked> attack to deal 500% or five times its usual base damage for the next five seconds. Alternatively, if the shield is held in place, 20 <linked>defense</linked> is temporarily gained; this lasts until the shield is once again lowered.
