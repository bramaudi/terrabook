    "The <b>Geyser</b> is a trap that spews a vertical stream of fire which deals a base damage of 40 / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\">80</abbr> / <abbr class=\"master\" title=\"Master Mode\">120</abbr> and a knockback of 2 <span>(Very weak)</span>. Geysers are found naturally-placed in random areas that are deep enough to generate lava, including the Underworld and deeper Cavern areas.",
    "On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, they will activate when a player touches them, and will generate without Pressure Plates or wires. However, they can still be triggered by wires.",
    "On the [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader version, they can only be triggered by wires, and will generate with Pressure Plates wired to them.",
    "They consume no ammunition, and their output is limited only by a cooldown period of 3.33 seconds. Geyser streams extend approximately 20 tiles up or down, depending on placement.",
    "Geysers can be placed on the top or bottom of blocks, facing upward or downward respectively, but not sideways."
