    "The <b>Chum Bucket</b> is a consumable which increases fishing power when thrown into a liquid. It is dropped with a <span class=\"chance\"><s>50*</s>1/2 (50%)</span> chance from Blood Moon enemies: the Wandering Eye Fish and Zombie Merman drop it in stacks of 4–6, and the Hemogoblin Shark, Blood Eel, and Dreadnautilus in stacks of 7–10. These enemies spawn when fishing during a Blood Moon.",
    "The fishing power bonus depends on how many Chum Buckets are present on the water's surface. A single bucket used will increase fishing power by 11, two for a total of 17 and finally three for a total max bonus of 20. This bonus is added after all other fishing factors and so isn't influenced by time factors like other fishing gear are; see the relevant section on Fishing for details.",
    "Each bucket lasts up to 10 times reeling in the line, even if nothing is on the line or if the line breaks.",
    "Using Chum Buckets does not change the chance of hooking enemies during a Blood Moon, but fishing using the Chum Caster doubles the chance."
