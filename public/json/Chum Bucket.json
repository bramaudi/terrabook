    "The <b>Chum Bucket</b> is a <linked>consumable</linked> item that increases <linked>fishing</linked> power when thrown into a liquid. It is dropped with a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"50\">1/2 (50%)</span> chance from <linked>Blood Moon</linked> enemies: the <linked>Wandering Eye Fish</linked> and <linked>Zombie Merman</linked> drop it in stacks of 4–6, and the <linked>Hemogoblin Shark</linked>, <linked>Blood Eel</linked>, and <linked>Dreadnautilus</linked> in stacks of 7–10. These enemies have a chance to spawn while fishing during a <linked>Blood Moon</linked>.",
    "The fishing power bonus depends on how many Chum Buckets are present on the water's surface. A single bucket used will increase fishing power by 11, two for a total of 17, and finally three for a total bonus of 20. This bonus is added after all other fishing factors and so is not influenced by time factors like other fishing gear are. See the relevant <linked>section on Fishing</linked> for details.",
    "Each bucket lasts up to 10 times reeling in the line, even if nothing is on the line or if the line breaks."
