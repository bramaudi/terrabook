    "The <b>Ragged Caster</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>enemy</linked> found in the <linked>post-Plantera Dungeon</linked>. It is most common in areas backed by <linked>Slab Walls</linked>. These are identified by the related <linked>Faction Flag</linked>, the <linked>Ragged Brotherhood Sigil</linked>.",
    "Ragged Casters attack by firing three homing projectiles at the player which inflict the <linked>Blackout</linked> <linked>debuff</linked>, decelerating as the projectiles approach the player. Blackout is a stronger version of the <linked>Darkness</linked> debuff, greatly lowering the player's light vision. Ragged Casters teleport to a different location on-screen after a period of time and have no delay between teleporting and attacking."
