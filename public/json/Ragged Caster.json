    "The <b>Ragged Caster</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>enemy</linked> that spawns in the <linked>Dungeon</linked> after Plantera is defeated. Ragged Casters attack by firing three homing Lost Soul projectiles at the player which inflict the <linked>Blackout</linked> <linked>debuff</linked> for 2–6 / <linked>4–12</linked> / <linked>5–15</linked> seconds, decelerating as the projectiles approach the player. Blackout is a stronger version of the <linked>Darkness</linked> debuff, greatly lowering the player's light vision. Ragged Casters teleport to a different location on-screen after firing six rounds of projectiles or immediately upon being hit.",
    "Ragged Casters are most common in Dungeon areas with <linked>Slab Walls</linked>, as indicated by the <linked>Ragged Brotherhood Sigils</linked> present within these sections."
