    "The <b>Tome of Infinite Wisdom</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>magic weapon</linked> that possesses two different modes of attack. When pressing the <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚒ Use / Attack</linked></span> button, the Tome of Infinite Wisdom fires bursts of four high-velocity pages that dissipate upon contact with <linked>enemies</linked> or solid tiles. When pressing the <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚷ Open / Activate</linked></span> button, it summons a large, high-velocity tornado that deals 175% of the weapon's base damage (63 damage), pierces an unlimited number of enemies, travels along blocks and through one-block low roofs, and dissipates after a duration of four seconds or upon being stopped by a wall of solid tiles. The Tome of Infinite Wisdom is dropped by <linked>Ogres</linked> during the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> <linked>event</linked>, with a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"10\">1/10 (10%)</span> / <linked>1/5 (20%)</linked> chance during Tier 2, and a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"5\">1/20 (5%)</span> chance during Tier 3.",
