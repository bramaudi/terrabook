    "<b>Beetle Armor</b> is a Hardmode, post-Golem armor set that provides melee and defensive bonuses. Though it is crafted from Turtle armor, it trades away the Thorns effect in exchange for stronger offensive or defensive bonuses (depending on which chest piece is worn). It is the final melee armor set available on the [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console version and Nintendo 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version] version. On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, and [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader version, it is the penultimate melee only armor set followed by Solar Flare armor.",
    "Beetle armor has two variants for its chest piece; <b>Beetle Scale Mail</b> and <b>Beetle Shell</b>. The Beetle Scale Mail enhances damage output and is slightly more agile, whereas the Beetle Shell provides more defense.",

The boost can be raised up to 30%, and the rate at which it increases depends on total damage dealt per second. Dealing less than roughly 180 damage per second will not grant Beetle Might at all. The buff depletes at an accelerating rate as long as the wearer does not deal damage, meaning that the buff will reset very quickly outside of combat.</li></ul>",

    "Crafting the full set with one chest piece requires 18 Beetle Husks and a full set of Turtle armor (54 Chlorophyte Bars (or 324 pieces of Chlorophyte Ore), and 3 Turtle Shells).
