    "The Scutlix Mount offers increased acceleration and land speed (41 <linked>mph</linked> top speed), increased jump height (20 tiles/40 feet), and its eyes automatically rapid-fire damaging red lasers at <linked>enemies</linked>. It also reduces <linked>fall damage</linked> to 1.",
    "Its lasers deal about 150 classless damage each (both fire each time and are accurate). The Scutlix can only target enemies in its field of vision, which is a roughly 120° cone in front of it, and cannot target enemies behind itself unless the player manually turns it around to face them, which also occurs when the player attacks in that direction."
