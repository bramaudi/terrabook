    "The <b>Flying Carpet</b> is an accessory that allows the player to float for about four seconds, similar to the Hoverboard. It can only be found inside Chests located within Pyramids in the Desert.",
    "The Flying Carpet is activated by holding <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Space Bar (PC default): Makes character jump\">â†· Jump</span></kbd></span> in mid-air, after all double-jumping accessories are used. Once it is activated, the player is put on an imaginary horizontal rail. Releasing the key deactivates the carpet, but it may be reactivated at a lower height if there is still flight time left."
