{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Dirt Rod","summaries":["The <b>Dirt Rod</b> is a unique tool that is used solely to move Dirt Blocks around, and is unlike the use of ordinary mining tools and block placement. When used while the cursor is over a Dirt Block, the block becomes a dirt ball that sticks to the cursor as long as the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Left Click (PC default): Use held item or attack\">âš’ Use / Attack</span></kbd></span> key is held down. The dirt ball can be carried through blocks and relocated anywhere on the screen. When released, the dirt ball is affected by gravity and also continues to carry the speed it was being moved at previously, allowing it to be \"thrown\". Upon impact with any blocks, a released dirt ball turns back into a solid Dirt Block.","The Dirt Rod is purchased from the Dryad for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"50000\"><span class=\"gc\">5</span></span> (<span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span>) / <span class=\"coin\" title=\"20 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"200000\"><span class=\"gc\">20</span></span> (<span class=\"eico i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span>)."],"statistics":{"Knockback":"5 <span class=\"knockback\">(Average)</span>","Use time":"20 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Magically moves dirt</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 1]</span>","Buy":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"50000\"><span class=\"gc\">5</span></span> <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / <span class=\"coin\" title=\"20 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"200000\"><span class=\"gc\">20</span></span> <span class=\"eico s i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Gold Coin\" data-sort-value=\"10000\"><span class=\"gc\">1</span></span> <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / <span class=\"coin\" title=\"4 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"40000\"><span class=\"gc\">4</span></span> <span class=\"eico s i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
