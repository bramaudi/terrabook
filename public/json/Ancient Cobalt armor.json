    "<b>Ancient Cobalt armor</b> is an armor set obtained from Hornets and Man Eaters in the Underground Jungle. Each piece is dropped individually with a <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.33*</s>1/300 (0.33%)</span> chance.",
    "The Ancient Cobalt armor design is based on a version of Cobalt armor that appeared before the 1.0.3 update, when it was replaced by Jungle armor. The old design was later re-introduced, in 1.2, as Ancient Cobalt armor. It currently shares identical stats with Jungle armor, but differs in appearance. Furthermore, Jungle armor and Ancient Cobalt armor pieces can be mixed and matched while still providing their set bonus.",
    "With a full set equipped, the player leaves an after-image effect when in motion, similar to Shadow armor, Necro armor, and the current version of Cobalt armor."
