    "<b>Beeswax</b> is a pet-summoning item that spawns a <b>Tiphia</b> when used. It grants the <b>Pet Tiphia</b> buff that lasts until the player manually cancels it by selecting the buff's icon in the buff menu, or if the player dies. The pet can deal 1â€“5 damage to an enemy if it runs into one, although it will not follow it.",
    "It is an uncommon drop from Dragon Hornets. It can also rarely be obtained from Gold Chests and Ivy Chests in the Underground Jungle.",
    "This pet will not teleport to the player when it is far away."
