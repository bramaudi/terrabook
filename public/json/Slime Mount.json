    "The <b>Slimy Saddle</b> is a mount-summoning item. When used, it summons a friendly <b>Slime Mount</b>. The Slime offers increased jump height (21 tiles) and movement speed (20 mph), decreases fall damage by half, and enables floating on water surfaces and continuous auto-jump by holding the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Space Bar (PC default): Makes character jump\">â†· Jump</span></kbd></span> key. On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, and [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader version, landing on enemies while riding this mount will deal 40 summon damage (excluding defense) to them in addition to pushing the player back up again. For this damage, the Slime Mount is considered a minion and benefits from effects that boost the damage of summons.",
