{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Heart","summaries":["<b>Hearts</b> (or <b>Candy Apples</b> during Halloween and <b>Candy Canes</b> during Christmas) are common power-ups which can be dropped by slain enemies, broken pots, or as a bonus drops from slimes. Enemies and pots will only drop Heart when the closest player does not have full health. They are not inventory items, but are instead instantly consumed and restore 20 health. They emit a faint red light.","If the player does not have full health but have full mana, the chance of an enemy dropping a Heart is <span class=\"chance\"><s>8.33*</s>1/12 (8.33%)</span>. If the player also does not have full mana, then this chance becomes <span class=\"chance\"><s>4.17*</s>1/24 (4.17%)</span>, as Hearts and Stars cannot be dropped at the same time. See Notes for more details. For the Heart drop chance from pots, see Pot ยง Upon breaking.","It is also possible to spawn Hearts (and their seasonal counterparts) with a Heart Statue.","Hearts can be collected within a range of 2.625 tiles, which can be increased with a Heartreach Potion to 18.25 tiles."],"statistics":{"Heals Health":"20","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 0]</span>"},"crafts":{}}
