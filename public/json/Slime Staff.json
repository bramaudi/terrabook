    "The <b>Slime Staff</b> is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon that summons a <b>Baby Slime</b> minion. Baby Slimes attack by bouncing on the ground and chasing enemies, rapidly dealing contact damage. Like other minions, the summoned Baby Slime is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world.",
    "The Slime Staff generally has the rarest drop chance of any weapon, with minor exceptions. The typical drop rate from most slimes and Slimed Zombies is <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.01*</s>1/10000 (0.01%)</span> / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\"><span class=\"chance\"><s>0.0143*</s>1/7000 (0.0143%)</span></abbr>. Pinky has a greatly increased drop rate of <span class=\"chance\"><s>1*</s>1/100 (1%)</span> / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\"><span class=\"chance\"><s>1.4286*</s>1/70 (1.4286%)</span></abbr>. Additionally, Sand Slimes have a drop rate of <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.0125*</s>1/8000 (0.0125%)</span> / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\"><span class=\"chance\"><s>0.0179*</s>1/5600 (0.0179%)</span></abbr>. The slimes which <i>cannot</i> drop the Slime Staff are: Lava, Dungeon, Umbrella, Hoppin' Jack, Corrupt (<span class=\"eil\"><span>Shadow</span><span class=\"eico s i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>), King Slime, Queen Slime, Crimslime, Gastropod (<span class=\"eil\"><span>Spectral</span><span class=\"eico s i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>), Rainbow.",
    "Unlike other summon weapons, its best possible modifier is <b>Mythical</b> because both the Ruthless and Mythical modifiers only raise its base damage to 9 due to rounding."
