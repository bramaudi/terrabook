    "The <b>Slime Staff</b> is a <linked>pre-Hardmode</linked> <linked>summon weapon</linked> that summons a <b>Baby Slime</b> <linked>minion</linked>. Baby Slimes attack by bouncing on the ground and chasing enemies, rapidly dealing contact damage. Like other <linked>minions</linked>, the summoned Baby Slime is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the <linked>buff</linked>, or leaves the world.",
    "The Slime Staff generally has the rarest drop chance of any <linked>weapon</linked>, with minor exceptions.
