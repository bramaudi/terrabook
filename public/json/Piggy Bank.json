    "The <b>Piggy Bank</b> is a portable, personal <linked>storage item</linked> which is purchased from the <linked>Merchant</linked> for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Gold Coin\" data-sort-value=\"10000\"><span class=\"gc\">1<i> GC</i></span></span>. Like other storage items (eg. <linked>Chests</linked>), it contains 40 slots (4 rows of 10) that can be used to store anything. The Piggy Bank requires only a space 2 wide and 1 high for placement, but must be placed on a <linked>Work Bench</linked>, <linked>Table</linked>, or <linked>Platforms</linked> (in contrast, the <linked>Safe</linked>, <span class=\"eil\"><span><linked>Defender's Forge</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span></span>, and <linked>Void Vault</linked> can be placed on <linked>blocks</linked>, but are considerably larger). The Piggy Bank inventory can also be accessed via the <span class=\"eil\"><span><linked>Money Trough</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span></span>, which summons a temporary floating version of the Piggy Bank, or the <span class=\"eil\"><span><linked>Eye Bone</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span></span>.",
    "Unlike normal chests etc, the Piggy bank (along with the Safe, Defender's Forge, and Void Vault) is considered \"personal storage\". Items contained in a Piggy Bank are attached to the character rather than to a container in the world: The bank can be picked up and moved regardless of the items within. <linked>Coins</linked> and items stored within it are safe from other players, and will not be dropped on <linked>death</linked>. They will even travel with a character who goes to a different world. However, if a <linked>Hardcore</linked> character dies, all items in their personal storage will be deleted with the character (and lost forever)."
