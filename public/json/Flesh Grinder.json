    "The <b>Flesh Grinder</b> is a hammer which is obtainable after the Brain of Cthulhu has been defeated. Like its Corruption counterpart, The Breaker, it is much more useful as a weapon than previous hammers, dealing a fair amount of damage and being capable of autoswing. Compared to The Breaker, the Flesh Grinder deals lower damage, but is faster and has slightly more range.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>. While <b>Light</b> may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool."
