    "For the Breathing Reed to take effect, it must be held, i.e. selected in the <linked>hotbar</linked> or being attached to the cursor. When held, the reed appears above the player and the rate at which their <linked>breath meter</linked> depletes is slowed and the rate at which they lose <linked>health</linked> while <linked>drowning</linked> is halved. The reed's tip does not need to be above the surface of the water for this to take effect. Additionally, the breath meter refills as soon as the tip of the reed is outside of water, but not within a <linked>block</linked>.",
