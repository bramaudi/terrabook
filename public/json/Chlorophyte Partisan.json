{"type":"weapons","title":"Chlorophyte Partisan","summaries":["The <b>Chlorophyte Partisan</b> is a Hardmode spear crafted using Chlorophyte Bars. It beats all of the \"standard\" ore spears, dealing 1 more damage than the best of the standard Hardmode ore spears, the Titanium Trident. When thrust, it emits a cloud of spores from the tip of the spear at the apex of the thrust, which looks exactly the same as the Chlorophyte Saber's projectile. The cloud travels a short distance in the direction the spear was thrust before fading out, and it is able to penetrate through solid blocks and multiple enemies, but it does not inflict any knockback.","Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."],"statistics":{"Damage":"49 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Melee)</span>","Knockback":"6.2 <span class=\"knockback\">(Strong)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"23 <span class=\"usetime\">(Fast)</span>","Velocity":"5","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Shoots a spore cloud</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 7]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"3 Gold 60 Silver Coins\" data-sort-value=\"36000\"><span class=\"gc\">3</span><span class=\"sc\">60</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{"Recipes":[{"result":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i multi-line\">[img:Chlorophyte Partisan]<span><span>Chlorophyte Partisan</span></span></span>"},"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Chlorophyte Bar]<span><span>Chlorophyte Bar</span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(12)</span></li></ul>"},"station":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i\">[img:Mythril Anvil]<span><span>Mythril Anvil</span></span></span><br><i><b>or</b></i><br><span class=\"i\">[img:Orichalcum Anvil]<span><span>Orichalcum Anvil</span></span></span>"}}]}}
