    "The <b>Drippler Crippler</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>flail</linked> that drops from <linked>Blood Eels</linked>. When used, it will spin around the player and can be thrown outwards to deal very high damage before being pulled back in. At the end of the throw, it also releases a projectile that bounces and is affected by gravity. The projectile deals half of the weapon's base damage and can hit up to two targets.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
