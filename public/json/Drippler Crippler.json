    "The <b>Drippler Crippler</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>flail</linked> which, in addition to the usual flail mechanics, fires a thorny ball projectile from the flail's head upon being thrown, which deals 50% of the weapon's base damage (73 damage). Thorny ball projectiles are heavily affected by gravity and dissipate after ricocheting off solid <linked>blocks</linked> twice or upon piercing two <linked>enemies</linked>.
