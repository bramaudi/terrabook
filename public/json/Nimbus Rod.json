    "The <b>Nimbus Rod</b> is a Hardmode magic weapon that creates clouds that cause damaging \"rain\" projectiles to fire downward. When cast, a cloud projectile is fired from the rod and travels towards the cursor. Upon reaching its destination or colliding with a solid block, the cloud stops and starts sending rain particles downward. Each drop of rain deals the weapon's stated damage and pierces through up to five enemies. Each cloud lasts for five minutes. Up to two clouds can be spawned at once; using the weapon when there are already two active clouds will cause the oldest cloud to disappear.",
    "The Nimbus Rod has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>6.67*</s>1/15 (6.67%)</span> chance of dropping from an Angry Nimbus, which spawns during rain.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Demonic</b> or <b>Deadly</b> for damage output, or <b>Mystic</b> for mana conservation because it cannot get modifiers that affect knockback. Because of the weapon's negligible mana cost, Demonic is usually preferred."
