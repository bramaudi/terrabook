    "The <b>Boots of Ostara</b> are an <linked>armor</linked> item dropped by <linked>Lepus</linked>. When worn, they provide 3 <linked>defense</linked> and create <linked>grass</linked> on <linked>Dirt Blocks</linked> under the player's feet. They will also enable the wearer to perform \"bunny hops\" where each successive jump in a series will increase in height until a maximum height of 16 tiles is reached. Jumping with the Boots of Ostara equipped creates a green particle effect."
