    "The <b>Pwnhammer</b> is a Hardmode hammer that is able to destroy Demon Altars and Crimson Altars with a few hits, blessing the world with one of the six Hardmode ores. It is always dropped by the Wall of Flesh. It has a sparkle effect when used which gives off a good deal of light, even in complete darkness.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>. While <b>Light</b> may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool."
