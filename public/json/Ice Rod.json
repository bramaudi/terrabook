If the cursor is on an existing Ice Block from a previous casting, it will cause the next projectile to pass through the existing Ice Block.","Regular blocks can be placed adjacent to the created Ice Blocks, which can prove useful in building floating structures (especially at higher elevations such as in Space), as it is not necessary to build a temporary connection from the ground or a Floating Island to the building site.","Its best modifier is <b>Mythical</b>."],"statistics":{"Damage":"28 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Magic)</span>","Knockback":"2 <span class=\"knockback\">(Very weak)</span>","Placeable":"<span class=\"t-yes\">✔️</span>","Mana":"6","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"9 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Velocity":"12","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Summons a block of ice</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 4]</span>","Buy":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"50 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"500000\"><span class=\"gc\">50</span></span> <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / <span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Platinum Coin\" data-sort-value=\"1000000\"><span class=\"pc\">1</span></span> <span class=\"eico s i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"10 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"100000\"><span class=\"gc\">10</span></span> <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / <span class=\"coin\" title=\"20 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"200000\"><span class=\"gc\">20</span></span> <span class=\"eico s i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
