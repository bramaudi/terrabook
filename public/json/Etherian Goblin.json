    "The <b>Etherian Goblin</b> is an enemy from the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> <linked>event</linked>, being the most common throughout most of the waves. It attacks by slowly approaching its target, hacking away with its weapon upon contact. Like many other enemies from the event, its appearance and stats change, depending on what point in the game the player has reached.",
    "If an Etherian Goblin's target is too far away or obstructed, it will enter an ethereal state, allowing it to pass through tiles. It is also unaffected by <linked>Teleporters</linked> or <linked>Lava</linked>.",
    "The Etherian Goblin requires 1000 kills to be awarded with its corresponding banner, as opposed to the usual 50 kills. The banner does not increase the damage the player deals nor does it decrease the damage the player receives."
