    "The <b>Gold Bow</b> is a strong type of bow crafted using Gold Bars, and is one of the strongest types of ore bows before one is able to obtain Demonite or Crimtane. It is the counterpart to the Platinum Bow, yet is beaten by it in power and speed. Its sole purpose is to fire arrows from a distance at enemies and deal damage to them.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Demonic</b>, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> It can also get the <b>Deadly</b> modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr>."
