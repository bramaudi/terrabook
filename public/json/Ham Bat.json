    "The <b>Ham Bat</b> is an early-Hardmode melee weapon that has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>4*</s>1/25 (4%)</span> chance to drop from Pigrons. In a Constant world, the drop chance is increased to <span class=\"chance\"><s>10*</s>1/10 (10%)</span>.",
    "Killing an enemy with the Ham Bat grants the <b>Hearty Meal</b> buff, which increases the player's health regeneration by 3 per second. This lasts for 7 seconds, but can be canceled at any time  by right-clicking the icon ([img:Desktop version]),  by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu ([img:Console version]), or  by double-tapping the buff icon ([img:Mobile version]). Hearty Meal will not stack upon killing another enemy; the duration instead resets.",
    "The Ham Bat's damage is slightly increased if a food buff is active; see the table on the right.",
