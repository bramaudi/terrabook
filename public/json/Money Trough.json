    "The <b>Money Trough</b> is a <linked>portable storage</linked> item that temporarily summons a flying <linked>pet</linked>-like version of the <linked>Piggy Bank</linked>. It has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.5*</s>1/200 (0.5%)</span> / <linked>1*1/100 (1%)</linked> chance to drop from the <linked>Drippler</linked> and the <linked>Blood Zombie</linked> during a <linked>Blood Moon</linked>, or with a much lower (<span class=\"chance\"><s>0.03*</s>1/4000 (0.03%)</span> / <linked>0.05*1/2000 (0.05%)</linked>) chance from their <linked>statue</linked>-spawned versions (regardless of whether a Blood Moon is occurring). It also has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>6.67*</s>1/15 (6.67%)</span> chance of dropping from the <linked>Zombie Merman</linked> and <linked>Wandering Eye Fish</linked>, which can be fished up during a Blood Moon.",
    "The Money Trough enables players to access their Piggy Bank contents without having to place the Piggy Bank or any <linked>furniture</linked> for it to rest on. The floating Piggy Bank despawns after 3 minutes, but can be re-summoned repeatedly at no cost. The Flying Piggy Bank does not follow the player like pets or <linked>minions</linked> would, instead it hovers stationarily at the point summoned. Once summoned, other players may use it as well to access their own Piggy Bank."
