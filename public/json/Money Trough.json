The floating Piggy Bank despawns after 3 minutes, but can be re-summoned repeatedly at no cost. The Flying Piggy Bank does not follow the player like pets or <linked>minions</linked> would, instead it hovers stationarily at the point summoned. Once summoned, other players may use it as well to access their own Piggy Bank."],"statistics":{"Use time":"28 <span class=\"usetime\">(Average)</span>","Velocity":"4","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Summons a flying piggy bank to store your items</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\"><linked>[img:Rarity level: 3]</linked></span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"2 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"20000\"><span class=\"gc\">2</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
