The floating Piggy Bank despawns after 3 minutes, but can be re-summoned repeatedly at no cost. The Flying Piggy Bank does not follow the player like pets or minions would, instead it hovers stationarily at the point summoned. Once summoned, other players may use it as well to access their own Piggy Bank."],"statistics":{"Use time":"28 <span class=\"usetime\">(Average)</span>","Velocity":"4","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Summons a flying piggy bank to store your items</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 3]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"2 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"20000\"><span class=\"gc\">2</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
