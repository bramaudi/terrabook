    "The <b>Shadowbeam Staff</b> is a Hardmode, post-Plantera magic weapon that is similar to the Necromancer's standard attack, creating a purple beam that travels instantaneously to its maximum distance (approximately 108 tiles), bounces off blocks, is unaffected by gravity, and emits a moderate amount of light for its entire length. It has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>5*</s>1/20 (5%)</span> / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\"><span class=\"chance\"><s>7.38*</s>59/800 (7.38%)</span></abbr> chance to drop from Necromancers in the Hardmode Dungeon.",
