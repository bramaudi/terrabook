    "The <b>Ornate Shadow Key</b> is a <linked>pet-summoning</linked> item that spawns a pet <b>Shadow Mimic</b> to follow the player around. When the player is far enough away or in midair, the Shadow Mimic propels itself by spinning towards them while emitting a trail of purple flames. It will also occasionally spit out non-collectible cosmetic coins. The Ornate Shadow Key has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"10\">1/10 (10%)</span> chance of being obtained from <linked>Shadow Chests</linked> and a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"5\">1/20 (5%)</span> chance of being obtained from <linked>Obsidian Crates</linked> and <linked>Hellstone Crates</linked>."
