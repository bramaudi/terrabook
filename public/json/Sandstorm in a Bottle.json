    "The <b>Sandstorm in a Bottle</b> is an accessory found only inside Gold Chests within Pyramids. It is similar to the Cloud in a Bottle, providing a double-jump that allows for some extra height, but instead of a cloud beneath the feet, a sand jet appears and the character visually spins as they ascend on that jet.",
    "The Sandstorm jump goes 15 blocks into the air, totalling 21 blocks when put together with the first jump. This is nearly twice as high as the height achievable with the Cloud in a Bottle."
