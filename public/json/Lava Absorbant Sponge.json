    "The <b>Lava Absorbant Sponge</b> is an item which functions similarly to the Super Absorbant Sponge, but absorbs Lava instead of Water. When used on a tile occupied with lava, it will delete the tile. The Lava Absorbant Sponge can be used an unlimited amount of times.  It also drains lava at a slightly faster speed than a standard empty bucket (especially when moving the cursor around while draining). It will not work on any other liquids.",
    "It is obtained as a rare drop from fishing in lava."
