    "The <b>Wolf</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>enemy</linked> that sometimes spawns in the <linked>Snow biome</linked> at <linked>night</linked>. It has the same <linked>AI</linked> as the <linked>Unicorn</linked>, which charges and rams into the player. Like Unicorns, Wolves move at very fast speeds and can jump fairly high, making them one of the hardest enemies to evade. Due to its relatively high defense and health, it is not recommended for early <linked>Hardmode</linked> players to fight these animals. If the player does happen to come across them, it is difficult to outrun them, even with <linked>Sprinting accessories</linked>."
