  "summaries": [
    "<b>Active Stone Blocks</b> and <b>Inactive Stone Blocks</b> are <linked>blocks</linked> that act as <linked>mechanisms</linked>. A given pair behave as a single block whose presence can be switched \"on\" or \"off\" using <linked>wire</linked> and a trigger.",
    "When triggered, an Active Stone Block becomes an Inactive Stone Block, and vice versa. Wires must pass through all Active/Inactive Stone Blocks that are to be triggered, and the wires must connect to a trigger, such as a <linked>pressure plate</linked>, <linked>Switch</linked>, or <linked>timer</linked>. These blocks are useful for creating <linked>traps</linked>, floodgates, hidden passages, drawbridges (e.g. over water, lava, or empty space), skybridges, and much more.",
    "<ul><li>An Active Stone Block is a <linked>foreground object</linked>. This means it looks and behaves as an ordinary <linked>Stone Block</linked>, inhibits movement, allows entities to stand or walk on it, blocks light, and can stop <linked>liquids</linked>.</li><li>An Inactive Stone Block is a background object. While still visible, it looks like darker Stone Block, and behaves like <linked>furniture</linked>. It is essentially empty space, allowing the passage of players, items, liquids, light, etc.</li></ul>",
    "Both the Active and Inactive versions can be crafted. Players will usually want to craft the Active version, as the Inactive blocks cannot be placed next to each other without the support of other adjacent foreground blocks. Active blocks do not have this shortcoming, and switching them to Inactive afterwards using wires will still have the same outcome.",
    "Placing Active Stone Blocks, switching them to Inactive with wiring, then mining them and picking them up again, will yield Inactive blocks, and vice versa.",
    "Active/Inactive Stone Blocks occur naturally in <linked>Boulder</linked> traps found in the <linked>Cavern</linked> layer, where Active blocks that are wired to pressure plates suspend a Boulder in the ceiling. An enemy or player walking on the plate cause the Active blocks to turn Inactive, allowing the Boulder to fall through and damage any player below it."
