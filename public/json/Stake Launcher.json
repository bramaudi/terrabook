{"type":"weapons","title":"Stake Launcher","summaries":["The <b>Stake Launcher</b> is a Hardmode, post-Plantera repeater-like weapon which auto-fires Stakes as ammunition. Stakes are not affected by gravity, pierce through 9 enemies, hitting a total of 10 enemies, and travel faster than most arrows. On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, the Stake Launcher applies a 10% damage penalty to the next hit for each enemy a projectile pierces. The Stake Launcher has a base 14% critical strike chance as opposed to the usual 4%. Additionally, it receives a substantial damage boost of 1000% against Vampires.","The Stake Launcher is dropped by Mourning Wood during the Pumpkin Moon event, and is always accompanied by 30 to 60 Stakes. The rate at which they drop scales based on the wave, starting at 2% from wave 4 and reaching a maximum of 20% during wave 15. Additional stakes are sold by the Witch Doctor and Arms Dealer while the Stake Launcher is in the player's inventory.","Its best modifier is <b>Unreal</b>."],"statistics":{"Uses ammo":"Stake","Damage":"75 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Ranged)</span>","Knockback":"6.5 <span class=\"knockback\">(Strong)</span>","Critical chance":"14%","Use time":"12 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span> <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / 26 <span class=\"usetime\">(Average)</span> <span class=\"eico s i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span>","Velocity":"9","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 8]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"10 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"100000\"><span class=\"gc\">10</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
