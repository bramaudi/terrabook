    "The <b>Silver Shortsword</b> is an early game metal shortsword. It is slightly weaker than its Tungsten version.",
    "Like all shortswords, the Silver Shortsword has a very limited range and attacks with a stabbing motion at any direction on [img:Desktop version] Desktop, [img:Console version] Console, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile, and horizontally in front of the player on [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console, 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version], and [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader, instead of an arc. This makes it almost useless against flying or jumping enemies, although its high attack rate makes it somewhat effective against weaker fighter type enemies.",
    "Unless the player has a good reason to make the Shortsword (like not having very much Silver, or for completionist purposes) they are advised to make the Silver Broadsword as it does more damage and can swing in an arc.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>."
