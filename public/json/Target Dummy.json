    "The <b>Target Dummy</b> is a <linked>furniture</linked> item that serves as a test target for player attacks. It can be attacked repeatedly by players, displaying <linked>damage</linked> numbers just as <linked>enemies</linked> would, in order to test the effective damage output of a <linked>weapon</linked> as affected by any <linked>modifiers</linked>, current <linked>buffs</linked>, or equipped boost items. The Dummy is indestructible, regardless of the amount of damage it takes. It can be freed using any <linked>pickaxe</linked>.",
    "The Target Dummy will also display damage and visual effects caused by damage-producing <linked>debuffs</linked>, allowing players to test their damage output, frequency, and duration. Though it visually recoils when struck, the Target Dummy is unresponsive to <linked>knockback</linked> and will never move."
