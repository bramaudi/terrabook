{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Guide Voodoo Doll","summaries":["The <b>Guide Voodoo Doll</b> is a summoning item for the Wall of Flesh. It is a guaranteed drop from Voodoo Demons, a fairly rare enemy in The Underworld.","When the doll is equipped as an accessory, it becomes possible for the player and other NPCs to kill the Guide with direct attacks from weapons (which normally would not damage him). If the item is dropped and destroyed by lava, then the Guide will instantly die, if he exists in the world. If the doll is destroyed in The Underworld (and the Guide exists), it will summon the Wall of Flesh.","On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, if more than one doll is in a stack upon being destroyed by lava, other NPCs will be killed alongside the guide depending on the amount within the stack.","The Guide Voodoo Doll cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers."],"statistics":{"Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">'You are a terrible person'</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 0]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"2 Silver Coins\" data-sort-value=\"200\"><span class=\"sc\">2</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
