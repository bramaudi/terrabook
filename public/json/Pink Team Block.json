    "<b>Team Blocks</b> are decorative blocks purchased from the Traveling Merchant for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Silver Coin\" data-sort-value=\"100\"><span class=\"sc\">1</span></span> each. Team Blocks are available in six different colors, each representing one of the six team colors selectable in the player's inventory, including white for the neutral team.",
    "Unlike Team Dye and Team Hair Dye, these blocks have no special function and are always the same color. The Traveling Merchant will only ever sell one color of Team Block at a time, along with the Team Platform of the same color, meaning that multiple visits will be required to collect all colors."
