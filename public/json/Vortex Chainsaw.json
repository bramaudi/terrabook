    "<b>Luminite Chainsaws</b> are four tools, all of which have the same stats. The four types are the <b>Solar Flare Chainsaw</b>, <b>Vortex Chainsaw</b>, <b>Nebula Chainsaw</b>, and the <b>Stardust Chainsaw</b>, each themed after different Celestial Pillars. They are all unable to be crafted, and instead the player must craft the Luminite Hamaxes.",
    "Like all axes and chainsaws, they are used to cut down trees, cacti, and giant glowing mushrooms, so the best possible modifier is <b>Godly</b>.",
    "With current methods, it is impossible to hack these items into a character's inventory using external editors, as they will disappear from that character's inventory as soon as they load into a world."
