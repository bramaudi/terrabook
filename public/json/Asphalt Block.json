  "summaries": [
    "<b>Asphalt Blocks</b> are unique blocks that dramatically increase the speed of players running along them, along with reducing the time it takes to stop running. Their acceleration stacks with other speed-boosting items such as the Hermes Boots and its derivative accessories. It only affects players running directly on it – the speed of Enemies, NPCs and Critters will remain unaffected. Immediately after jumping or falling off of Asphalt Blocks, the speed will return to normal.",
    "With no other boosts, running on asphalt has a max speed of 53 mph, with about 3 seconds of acceleration, while the normal maximum running speed is 15 mph."
