    "The <b>Crystal Serpent</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>magic weapon</linked> that fires a magical pink charge that shatters into 3-5 smaller sparks upon impact with an <linked>enemy</linked> or solid <linked>block</linked>, each of which deals 80% base damage and knockback (32 base damage and a knockback of 3.52 <span class=\"knockback\">(Weak)</span>). These sparks are affected by gravity and ricochet against solid blocks, lasting one second before disappearing. When fired at a one-block-thick wall, one of the splash projectiles has a chance of passing through to the other side.
