    "The <b>Moth</b> is a rare Hardmode enemy that spawns in the Underground Jungle. It flies around very slowly, and upon seeing the player, will direct its attention towards them and attempt to deal damage to them. Upon killing the Moth, there is a chance that it will drop Butterfly Dust, which is solely used to craft Butterfly Wings. On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, it will only drop if any mechanical boss has been defeated.",
