    "The <b>Spore Sac</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>accessory</linked> that continuously spawns multiple stationary floating spores around the player that act as homing mines. When an enemy comes within range, they slowly swarm the enemy and cause small explosions on contact, dealing about 400 classless damage over the course of 1 second. Spores have the ability to pass through <linked>blocks</linked> to reach enemies and will inflict the <linked>Poisoned</linked> <linked>debuff</linked> for 5â€“10 seconds. They have a small area of effect that can hit multiple targets. The Spore Sac is always dropped from <linked>Plantera</linked>'s <linked>Treasure Bag</linked> in <linked>Expert Mode</linked>.",
    "Spores can only spawn near <linked>blocks</linked>, or on background <linked>walls</linked>, that are up to 25 tiles away from the player. Each spore fades after 20 seconds and is replaced by a new one while a valid area exists in range. Flying in open areas (eg. via <linked>Wings</linked> or <linked>Mounts</linked>) with no walls or blocks in range will not result in any spores spawned. When spawning near blocks, with no background walls, only a single layer of spores spawns, floating within about 3 tiles of the blocks. On background walls, spores can spawn anywhere in mid-air."
