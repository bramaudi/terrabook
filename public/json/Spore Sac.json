    "The <b>Spore Sac</b> is a Hardmode accessory that is obtained from the Treasure Bag dropped by Plantera in Expert Mode. When equipped, it continuously spawns multiple stationary floating spores around the player that act as homing mines. When an enemy comes within range, they slowly swarm the enemy and cause small explosions on contact, dealing about 400 damage over 1 second. Spores have the ability to pass through blocks to reach enemies, and will inflict the Poisoned debuff. They have a small area-effect that can hit multiple targets.",
    "Spores can only spawn near blocks, or on background walls, that are up to 25 tiles away from the player. Flying in open areas (eg. via Wings or Mounts) with no walls or blocks in range will not result in any spores spawned. When spawning near blocks, with no background walls, only a single layer of spores spawns, floating within about 3 tiles of the blocks. On background walls, spores can spawn anywhere in mid-air."
