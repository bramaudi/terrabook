    "The <b>Portal Gun Station</b> is a <linked>furniture</linked> item that can fire portals, similar to the <linked>Portal Gun</linked>, but as a stationary furniture item. It is purchased from the <linked>Cyborg</linked> for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"10 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"100000\"><span class=\"gc\">10</span></span>, if the player has a Portal Gun in their <linked>inventory</linked>.",
    "Right-click (<span class=\"key\"><linked>⚷ Open / Activate</linked></span>) the top of the Station to toggle orange/blue portal colors, or at the base to fire a portal. Right-click ( <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚷ Open / Activate</linked></span>) the left or right side of the Station to rotate its shooting direction.",
    "The Station can also act as a <linked>mechanism</linked> if connected by <linked>wires</linked> to a triggering mechanism, such as a <linked>Switch</linked> or <linked>Lever</linked>. A wire connected to the top of the Station toggles its portal color, the bottom fires a portal, and the left or right rotates the firing direction.",
    "In multiplayer, if the source of activation is not directly a player, then the station will not fire nor swap colors, though any signal can rotate the station. For example, flipping a switch that fires a <linked>dart trap</linked> at a <linked>Teal Pressure Pad</linked> connected to the Station will not result in the Station firing, as it can't find a player to bind its portals to. Note that other, player-based activators like arrows or minions <i>will</i> cause the Teal Pressure Pad to activate the station. <linked>Timers</linked> and <linked>Sensors</linked> also cannot fire the station.",
    "Only one orange and one blue portal can exist at a time for each player that has the Portal Gun or Portal Gun Station, whether created by the former or the latter."
