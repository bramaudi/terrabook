    "The <b>Silly Balloon Machine</b> is a novelty <linked>furniture</linked> <linked>mechanism</linked> that produces red, blue, and green balloons continuously once placed. It can be activated and deactivated via <linked>wire</linked>, but is always on by default when first placed. Once placed, balloons are produced at short random intervals, and rise in the air until they encounter an obstacle like a block or platform. Balloons do not burst or disappear upon colliding with objects, but those do hinder their movement. All balloons fade away after approximately 10 seconds.",
    "The balloons are purely visual, with no functional effect, and can be produced infinitely at no cost. The Silly Balloon Machine is purchased from the <linked>Party Girl</linked> for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"50000\"><span class=\"gc\">5</span></span>."
