{"type":"weapons","title":"Imp Staff","summaries":["The <b>Imp Staff</b> is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon. It spawns a miniature <b>Flying Imp</b> minion that follows the player around and fires fireballs at enemies. The Imp's fireballs always inflict the On Fire! debuff for 3â€“6 seconds, and travel in a straight line, piercing up to 4 enemies. Like other minions, the summoned Imp is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world.","<span class=\"eico i3 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Imp Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback.","<span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> Its best modifier is <b>Mythical</b>.
