    "The <b>Sonar Potion</b> is a buff potion which grants the <b>Sonar</b> buff when consumed. When fishing while under the effects of the potion, the name of what will be caught will appear above the lure when it is bitten. This lasts for 8 minutes, but can be canceled at any time  by right-clicking the icon ([img:Desktop version] [img:Legacy tModLoader version]),  by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu ([img:Console version] [img:Old-gen console version]),  by double-tapping the buff icon ([img:Mobile version]), or  by canceling the buff from the buffs screen ([img:Nintendo 3DS version]).",
    "This potion is especially useful, allowing the player to not waste bait on unnecessary fish as the cast can be left in the water until another fish bites at the line. This can be useful for angler quests as well as crate fishing. It also makes it so the player cannot get trash items even if they reel them in."
