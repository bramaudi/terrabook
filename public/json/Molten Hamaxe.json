    "The <b>Molten Hamaxe</b> is a tool which functions as both a hammer and an axe, and is an upgrade from the Meteor Hamaxe. It is crafted solely using Hellstone Bars. This tool has a chance of inflicting the On Fire! debuff. Its hammer and axe powers are the highest of all pre-Hardmode tools. While it has more axe power than most Hardmode axes, it is hindered in usage by its comparatively slow tool speed, making many later tools a better choice.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>. While <b>Light</b> may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool."
