    "The <b>Shadewood Sword</b> is an alternate version of the Wooden Sword made using Shadewood from the Crimson biome. It is functionally identical to its Corruption counterpart, the Ebonwood Sword. Both deal slightly more damage and have a slightly increased speed compared to the Wooden Sword and its variants. With it being stronger than the other wooden swords, it can be useful early on, though one should proceed with caution, as the Crimson is a very dangerous place for players early on.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>."
