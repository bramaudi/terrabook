    "<b>Jellyfish</b> are enemies found in water. When underwater, they attack by propelling themselves towards the player in short bursts. When outside of water, they will be unable to move or pursue the player in any way. Jellyfish are able to jump out of the water to attack players, often leaving them stranded on land. Most varieties of Jellyfish produce light, making them easy to spot in dark areas. There are currently 5 Jellyfish variants, 3 of which only appear during Hardmode. <span class=\"eico i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span> Blue Jellyfish only spawn in pre-Hardmode and are replaced by the Green variant in Hardmode.",
    "In <span class=\"eil\"><span>Expert Mode</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>, Jellyfish will periodically become electrified, making them invincible for the duration of the attack. A Jellyfish will constantly maintain its speed while electrified unless it comes into contact with a wall or the water's surface. If the player attacks a Jellyfish with a sword while it is electrified (or any other swung item that deals direct damage, such as most tools), the player will be hurt by 1.3× contact damage of the Jellyfish. <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> This also applies to projectile contact weapons (Spears, Shortswords, Solar Eruption, Sleepy Octopod, Sky Dragon's Fury, and Whips)."
