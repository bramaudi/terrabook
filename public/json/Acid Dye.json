    "<b>Acid Dye</b> is a <linked>dye</linked> acquired by giving a <linked>Strange Plant</linked> to the <linked>Dye Trader</linked>. <linked>Armor</linked> dyed by it can be seen in the dark, but does not provide light. It also gives a rippling effect that pulses outwards from the player's head. It can sometimes be used for exploring, but the fact that it does not provide real light makes it mostly of use for decoration.",
