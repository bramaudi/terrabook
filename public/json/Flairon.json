{"type":"weapons","title":"Flairon","summaries":["The <b>Flairon</b> is a Hardmode melee weapon that repeatedly fires a ball-and-chain up to around 25 tiles from the player while releasing homing bubble projectiles that damage enemies. The Flairon has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>20*</s>1/5 (20%)</span> chance of being dropped by Duke Fishron.","The Flairon is a launched flail, that, despite its appearance, is more similar in function to the Chain Knife, the KO Cannon, and the Golem Fist than a normal flail. It is not affected by gravity, does not remain deployed when holding the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Left Click (PC default): Use held item or attack\">⚒ Use / Attack</span></kbd></span> button, and cannot be swung around. Rather, holding the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Left Click (PC default): Use held item or attack\">⚒ Use / Attack</span></kbd></span> button causes it to auto-fire repeatedly, returning and re-firing when it impacts a block or enemy, or when it reaches its maximum range.","Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."],"statistics":{"Damage":"66 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Melee)</span>","Knockback":"4.5 <span class=\"knockback\">(Average)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"20 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Velocity":"14","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Spews homing bubbles</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 8]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"50000\"><span class=\"gc\">5</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
