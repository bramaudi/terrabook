    "The <b>Terragrim</b> is a rare <linked>melee weapon</linked> that appears to be a <linked>sword</linked>, but does not present an actual blade when used. Instead of an overhead <linked>broadsword</linked> swing or a <linked>shortsword</linked> stab, the Terragrim <linked>autoswings</linked> and appears as a series of blurred slashes aimed in the direction of the cursor. Anything within this area takes constant damage at a rate far exceeding the weapon's stated <linked>use time</linked>. This damaging area has a rather wide spread, even attacking behind the player for a very short distance.",
    "It is obtainable from the unique <linked>background object</linked> found in an <linked>Enchanted Sword Shrine</linked> or very rarely in the Caverns layer. When the object is destroyed, it has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>2*</s>1/50 (2%)</span> chance to drop a Terragrim rather than an <linked>Enchanted Sword</linked>.",
    "The <linked>Arkhalis</linked> is the Terragrim's <linked>Hardmode</linked>, <linked>Expert</linked>-exclusive upgrade.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount. The Terragrim's unique means of attack is unaffected by any size and speed modifiers."
