{"type":"weapons","title":"Terragrim","summaries":["The <b>Terragrim</b> is a rare pre-Hardmode melee weapon that appears to be a sword, but does not present an actual blade when used. Instead of an overhead broadsword swing or a shortsword stab, the Terragrim autoswings and appears as a series of blurred slashes aimed in the direction of the cursor. Anything within this area takes constant damage at a rate far exceeding the weapon's stated use time. This damaging area has a rather wide spread, even attacking behind the player for a very short distance.","It is obtainable from the unique background object found in an Enchanted Sword Shrine or very rarely in the Caverns layer. When the object is destroyed, it has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>2*</s>1/50 (2%)</span> chance to drop a Terragrim rather than an Enchanted Sword.","The Terragrim's unique means of attack is unaffected by any size and speed modifiers.","Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."],"statistics":{"Damage":"17 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Melee)</span>","Knockback":"3 <span class=\"knockback\">(Very weak)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"25 <span class=\"usetime\">(Fast)</span>","Velocity":"15","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Unleashes a dicing flurry</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 2]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"50000\"><span class=\"gc\">5</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
