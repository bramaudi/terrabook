    "<b>Medusa</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>enemy</linked> found near <linked>Marble Caves</linked>. She is a relatively fast-moving melee attacker who has the unique ability to inflict the <linked>Stoned</linked> <linked>debuff</linked> through her gaze. This debuff deals 20 / <linked>40</linked> / <linked>60</linked> damage to the player and turns the player to stone:",
    "<ul><li>The player will be unable to move or use items for the duration of the debuff, similar to the <linked>Frozen</linked> debuff.</li><li>Fall damage-negating accessories are disabled, <linked>fall damage</linked> is increased, and the minimum distance for fall damage to occur is reduced.</li></ul>",
    "The debuff's onset is marked by Medusa's snake hair (as well as Medusa herself) lashing out red tongues, accompanied by a unique noise and particle effect, giving players notice before they are petrified. Players can avoid getting Stoned by facing the other direction when the animation completes, or by having Medusa's line of sight blocked by solid blocks.",
    "She is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <linked>Lifeform Analyzer</linked> or its upgrades."
