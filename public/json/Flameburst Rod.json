    "The <b>Flameburst Rod, Cane, and Staff</b> are special sentry summon weapons. They can summon the <b>Flameburst Tower</b> sentry, which lasts for <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 10 minutes / <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 2 minutes, remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. Each Flameburst Tower fires fireballs at approaching enemies, which are non-piercing but can cause splash damage on impact and have a chance to inflict the On Fire! debuff. Unlike other projectile sentries, the Flameburst Tower is unable to aim and shoots upward at an angle greater than 45Â°; flying enemies are therefore ignored when they fly above it. The Rod is sold by the Tavernkeep for <span data-info=\"50000\" class=\"coins\" title=\"5 Defender Medals\"><s>50000*</s>5 [img:Defender Medal]</span>, the Cane for <span data-info=\"250000\" class=\"coins\" title=\"25 Defender Medals\"><s>250000*</s>25 [img:Defender Medal]</span>, and the Staff for <span data-info=\"1000000\" class=\"coins\" title=\"100 Defender Medals\"><s>1000000*</s>100 [img:Defender Medal]</span>.",
    "The Rod is always available. The Cane becomes available after defeating one mechanical boss, and the Staff becomes available after defeating Golem. The three different versions cause an identical effect, but with varying statistics, with the Staff being the most expensive and the most powerful.",
    "These weapons cannot be used outside of the Old One's Army event until the event has been successfully completed. Completing the event on any difficulty allows Rods, Canes, and Staves alike to be used outside of the event.",
    "During the Old One's Army event, Etherian Mana can be collected, which allows the placement of multiple Flameburst Towers that remain permanently until the event is over. Etherian Mana cannot be used outside the event.",
    "Flameburst Tower sentries are boosted by the Apprentice armor and Dark Artist armor set bonuses, which dramatically increase their range, field of view, and projectile velocity. The Dark Artist armor will also boost the explosion radius of the sentries' projectiles.",
    "Their best modifier is <b>Mythical</b>."
