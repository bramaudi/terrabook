{"type":"weapons","title":"Harpoon","summaries":["The <b>Harpoon</b> is a unique pre-Hardmode ranged weapon. It auto-fires an arcing projectile which is connected to the player via a chain, and returns after reaching a maximum distance or impacting. Its physics are similar to launched flails, though it is highly affected by gravity. The Harpoon is dropped by most enemies during a Goblin Army with a chance of <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.5*</s>1/200 (0.5%)</span>.","The Harpoon has no cooldown period; its auto-fire rate dependent only on the distance to its impact, meaning that an enemy or object in close range will cause a faster auto-fire rate. The projectile also deals damage and knockback to multiple enemies on its return trip, similar to a flail or boomerang, making it effective for crowd control.","Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."],"statistics":{"Damage":"25 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Ranged)</span>","Knockback":"6 <span class=\"knockback\">(Average)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"30 <span class=\"usetime\">(Average)</span>","Velocity":"11","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 2]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"54 Silver Coins\" data-sort-value=\"5400\"><span class=\"sc\">54</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
