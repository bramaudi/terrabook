Nearby swinging tools will not accidentally break plants in a Planter Box.",
    "Unlike Clay Pots, Planter Boxes are placed and act like <linked>platforms</linked>: They do not require support beneath them and they can be walked on, but pressing <span class=\"key\"><linked>▼ Down</linked></span> will let a player fall through them.",
    "Although the various Planter Boxes have different seed names and appearances, the differences are purely cosmetic: Any herb seeds can grow in any Planter Box, and planting seeds in their respective Planter Boxes will not provide any extra benefit. Depending on the <linked>evil biome</linked> of the world, the Dryad will sell a <linked>Deathweed</linked> Planter Box showing either <linked>Corrupt grass</linked> or <linked>Crimson grass</linked>."
