    "<b>Planter Boxes</b> are special gardening objects purchased from the <linked>Dryad</linked> for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Silver Coin\" data-sort-value=\"100\"><span class=\"sc\">1<i> SC</i></span></span> each in which <linked>herb</linked> or <linked>flower seeds</linked> can be planted. If left empty, <linked>wild grass plants</linked> will randomly grow out of them, provided the box is placed on the <linked>surface</linked> or in <linked>Space</linked>. The plant in a Planter Box cannot be cut in the regular manner, e.g. via nearby swinging tools. Instead, it needs to be removed with a <linked>pickaxe</linked> or <linked>drill</linked>, or the <linked>Staff of Regrowth</linked> or <linked>Axe of Regrowth</linked>.",
    "Planter Boxes are placed and act like <linked>platforms</linked>: They do not require support beneath them and they can be walked on, but pressing <span class=\"key\"><linked>▼ Down</linked></span> will let a player fall through them.",
    "Although the various Planter Boxes have different seed names and appearances, the differences are purely cosmetic: Any herb seeds can grow in any Planter Box, and planting seeds in their respective Planter Boxes will not provide any extra benefit. Depending on the <linked>evil biome</linked> of the world, the Dryad will sell a <linked>Deathweed</linked> Planter Box showing either <linked>Corrupt grass</linked> or <linked>Crimson grass</linked>."
