    "The <b>Obsidian Swordfish</b> is a Hardmode spear. It has the second-highest base damage of any spear (beaten only by the North Pole). However, it is very short compared to other Hardmode spears. It is obtained via fishing in lava, by <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> using any lava fishing method (including lava bait or Lavaproof Fishing Hook) during Hardmode, or <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> only by using the Hotline Fishing Hook.",
    "The Obsidian Swordfish has an extraordinarily high base critical strike chance of 24% as opposed to the usual 4%. This gives it not only the highest base critical strike chance of any melee weapon, but also the second highest of any weapon, tied with the <span class=\"eil\"><span>Sky Fracture</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> and surpassed only by the Sniper Rifle.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
