    "<b>Wooden Spikes</b> are a type of <linked>trap</linked> <linked>block</linked> that damage players who come in contact with it. They are the upgrade of regular, metal <linked>Spikes</linked>, and, despite their name and appearance suggesting that they are made of a weaker material, they deal more damage than the metal variant; players that touch Wooden Spikes take <span class=\"eico i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 60 / <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 80 damage. Found in the <linked>Jungle Temple</linked>, they can be broken with any <linked>drill</linked>, <linked>pickaxe</linked>, or <linked>explosive</linked>, unlike the <linked>Lihzahrd Bricks</linked> found around them, which require a <linked>Picksaw</linked> or stronger mining tool to break. This is the only way to obtain them, as they are not craftable."
