    "<b>Wooden Spikes</b> are a type of trap block that damage players who come in contact with it. They are the upgrade of regular, metal Spikes, and, despite their name and appearance suggesting that they are made of a weaker material, they deal more damage than the metal variant; players that touch Wooden Spikes take <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 60 / <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 80 damage. Found in the Jungle Temple, they can be broken with any drill, pickaxe, or explosive (<span class=\"eico i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span> like other types of traps), unlike the Lihzahrd Bricks found around them, which require a Picksaw or stronger mining tool to break. This is the only way to obtain them, as they are not craftable."
