    "<span class=\"eico i5\" title=\"3DS version\"><b></b><i></i></span> Spooky armor is the second most powerful summoning armor in the game, roughly tied with Tiki armor, and beaten by Stardust armor. It provides a noticeable increase in bonus damage over the comparable Tiki armor, at the cost of one minion (<span class=\"eico i3\" title=\"Old-gen console version\"><b></b><i></i></span> except on old-gen Console, where both sets provide the same number of minions) and some defense. If the player does not have at least one <linked>accessory</linked> and/or <linked>buff</linked> that increases the minion capacity, Tiki armor will actually cause minions to deal more damage, with the upper hand of more defense. If there is no increase in minion capacity, Spooky armor increases minion damage by 632% (with 4 minions), while Tiki armor increases the damage by 650% (with 5 minions). When the player can summon 1 extra minion, Spooky armor increases minion damage by 790%, while Tiki armor only increases it by 780%. The more minions that can be summoned, the more damage minions do with Spooky armor.",
