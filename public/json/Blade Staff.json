    "The <b>Blade Staff</b> is a Hardmode summon weapon that summons an <b>Enchanted Dagger</b> minion suspended above the player's head, attacking enemies within range by flying toward and through them repeatedly at a fast pace. It has 25 armor penetration, making it more effective against Hardmode enemies than its damage stat would indicate. The Blade Staff is dropped by Queen Slime with a drop rate of <span class=\"chance\"><s>25*</s>1/4 (25%)</span> / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\"><span class=\"chance\"><s>33.33*</s>1/3 (33.33%)</span></abbr>.",
    "Its best modifiers are <b>Demonic</b>, <b>Deadly</b>, <b>Mystic</b>, or <b>Hurtful</b>. Unlike most minions, the Enchanted Dagger deals no knockback, so the weapon cannot obtain the Ruthless modifier. Due to its low base damage, all modifiers which improve damage by 10% or more improve its damage by the same amount."
