    "<b>Hornets</b> are flying enemies found in the Underground Jungle. They follow the Flying AI, floating just out of reach and then charging the player, while also firing stinger projectiles (at an increased rate in <span class=\"eil\"><span>Expert Mode</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>).",
    "These stingers have a <span class=\"chance\"><s>33.33*</s>1/3 (33.33%)</span> chance to inflict the Poisoned debuff on the player for 10 seconds. In Expert mode, the chance is <span class=\"chance\"><s>33.33*</s>1/3 (33.33%)</span> for 20 seconds and <span class=\"chance\"><s>66.67*</s>2/3 (66.67%)</span> for 2â€“10 seconds. The stingers cannot be destroyed with weapons and travel at about the same speed as the darts from a Dart Trap."
