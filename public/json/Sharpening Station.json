    "The <b>Sharpening Station</b> is a <linked>furniture</linked> item found naturally generated in <linked>Underground Cabins</linked> in the <linked>Underground Jungle</linked>.

    "Placing and pressing <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚷ Open / Activate</linked></span> on the Sharpening Station grants the <b>Sharpened</b> <linked>buff</linked>, which increases <linked>armor penetration</linked> of all <linked>melee weapons</linked> by 12. This lasts until the player <linked>dies</linked> or leaves the world, but can be canceled at any time  by right-clicking the icon (<linked>[img:Desktop version]</linked>),  by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu (<linked>[img:Console version]</linked>), or  by double-tapping the buff icon (<linked>[img:Mobile version]</linked>).",
    "Unlike <linked>equipment buff items</linked>, the Sharpening Station must be placed in order to activate the buff. It can be mined with a <linked>pickaxe</linked> or <linked>drill</linked> and picked up again, even while the buff is active, which will not cancel the buff. Placement is only dependent on an adequate space of 3×2 tiles being available."
