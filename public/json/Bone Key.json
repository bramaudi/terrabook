    "The <b>Bone Key</b> is a <linked>pet-summoning</linked> item that spawns a <b>Baby Skeletron Head</b> to follow the player around. The Baby Skeletron Head floats around the player and sometimes spins its head, similarly to <linked>Skeletron</linked>'s spinning head attack or the <linked>Dungeon Guardians</linked> in general. This action may also occur if the player is a bit further away from the Skeletron Head. The Bone Key is always dropped from the <linked>Dungeon Guardian</linked>. Because Dungeon Guardians have extremely high stats intended to instantly kill all players, this can be a difficult item to acquire."
