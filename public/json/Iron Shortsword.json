    "The <b>Iron Shortsword</b> is an early game metal shortsword. It's stronger than the Copper and Tin Shortsword and has a slightly stronger alternate version known as the Lead Shortsword.",
    "Like all shortswords, the Iron Shortsword has a very limited range and attacks with a stabbing motion at any direction on [img:Desktop version] Desktop, [img:Console version] Console, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile, and horizontally in front of the player on [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console, 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version], and [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader, instead of an arc. This makes it almost useless against flying or jumping enemies, although its high attack rate makes it somewhat effective against weaker fighter type enemies.",
    "Unless the player has a good reason to make the Shortsword (like not having very much Iron or for completionist purposes) they are advised to make the Iron Broadsword as it does more damage and can swing in an arc.",
    "At the creation of a Journey Mode character, the player will receive an Iron Shortsword to start off rather than the traditional Copper Shortsword.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>."
