{"type":"weapons","title":"Egg Cannon","summaries":["The <b>Egg Cannon</b> is a ranged weapon that has a 50% chance to be dropped by Lepus. It uses bullets for ammo, but fires projectiles that resemble Suspicious Looking Eggs. Because of this, bullets like the Cursed Bullet have no effect on the resulting projectiles.","The eggs have a small chance to spawn a Bunny (on a Blood Moon, a Corrupt Bunny) or a Bird on impact. They are also affected by gravity (no matter the ammo), but they can travel long distances.","The Egg Cannon cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers."],"statistics":{"Damage":"16 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Ranged)</span>","Knockback":"0.5 <span class=\"knockback\">(Extremely weak)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Tooltip":"<i>\"To kill a goblin, you have to break a few eggs\"</i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 2]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Gold Coin\" data-sort-value=\"10000\"><span class=\"gc\">1</span></span>"},"crafts":{}}
