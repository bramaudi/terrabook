    "The <b>High Test Fishing Line</b> is an accessory that prevents fishing line from breaking while fishing, when equipped. It is acquired as a <span class=\"chance\"><s>2.5*</s>1/40 (2.5%)</span> chance reward for completing a Fishing quest for the Angler NPC, depending on the number of completed quests and other factors (for details, see Angler).",
    "Without the High Test Fishing Line equipped, there is a <span class=\"chance\"><s>14.29*</s>1/7 (14.29%)</span> chance that the line will break on any reel-in that was supposed to yield a catch.",
    "On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, the Angler will not give the player a High Test Fishing Line as a reward if they already have one in their inventory or in any of their portable storage items. However, if the player has a High Test Fishing Line, Angler Earring, <i>and</i> Tackle Box (or they have one of the accessories crafted from them, the <span class=\"eil\"><span>Angler Tackle Bag</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> or <span class=\"eil\"><span>Lavaproof Tackle Bag</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>) in their inventories, he will be able to give the player duplicate High Test Fishing Lines."
