    "The <b>North Pole</b> is a Hardmode, post-Plantera spear dropped by the Ice Queen during the Frost Moon event. It fires a deadly icy spear projectile with no mana or ammo cost, similar to the Daybreak. The projectile travels straight and is then affected by gravity. It leaves a trail of snowflakes that deal damage, effectively \"carpet bombing\" the area between the player and the landing point of the projectile. The projectile fired will break upon contact with any enemy or block, <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> and the weapon does not have autoswing.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
