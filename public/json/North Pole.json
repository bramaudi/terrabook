    "The <b>North Pole</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>spear</linked> that fires an icy spear projectile that costs no <linked>mana</linked> or <linked>ammunition</linked>. The spear projectile travels in a straight line in midair for half a second before being affected by gravity and can pierce up two enemies before dissipating upon contact with a solid <linked>block</linked> or upon impacting a third enemy. Additionally, the icy spear leaves behind a trail of snowflakes which fall downwards and dissipate upon contact with an enemy or surface. The North Pole's spear projectile inflicts 85% of the weapon's base <linked>knockback</linked> (5.695 <span class=\"knockback\">(Average)</span>), while snowflakes inflict 46.75% of its base knockback (3.132 <span class=\"knockback\">(Weak)</span>).
