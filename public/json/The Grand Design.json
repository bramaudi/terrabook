    "<b>The Grand Design</b> is a <linked>tool</linked> for working with wiring and <linked>mechanisms</linked>. It combines and extends the abilities of its components: It allows a controlled view of wiring (<linked>Mechanical Lens</linked>), and allows the player to place or remove any color of <linked>wire</linked> (<linked>Multicolor Wrench</linked>); unlike its components, it also shows and works with <linked>Actuators</linked>. It also provides the <linked>Mechanical Ruler</linked>'s ability to measure distances and relative positions.",
    "Creating the Grand Design costs <span class=\"coin\" title=\"15 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"150000\"><span class=\"gc\">15<i> GC</i></span></span> in total. Its components are all bought from the <linked>Mechanic</linked>, and it is crafted at the <linked>Tinkerer's Workshop</linked>, which is bought from the <linked>Goblin Tinkerer</linked>. Given the requirements of these NPCs spawning, it can only be crafted after defeating <linked>Skeletron</linked> and the <linked>Goblin Army</linked>.",
    "The Grand Design can be used at any part of the screen, regardless of block placement range.",
    "When pressing <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚷ Open / Activate</linked></span> with the tool, a menu with six different buttons will be displayed, five for selecting Actuator and four colors of wires, one for toggling between placing or harvesting selected colors of wires and Actuator.",
    "<ul><li><linked>[img:Desktop version]</linked> <linked>[img:Console version]</linked> The menu will pop up at the cursor's position, with buttons in a radial pattern.</li><li><linked>[img:Mobile version]</linked> The menu will pop up above the <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚷ Open / Activate</linked></span> button, with buttons listed in two rows.</li></ul>",
    "When the menu is closed, five small colored square icons will appear near the cursor, showing the current mode (placing/harvesting) and selected wires/actuator.",
    "In addition, as long as The Grand Design is anywhere in the inventory, it will provide seven <linked>toggles</linked>, controlling the functions of <linked>Mechanical Ruler</linked> and <linked>Mechanical Lens</linked>."
