    "The <b>Angler Earring</b> is an accessory that provides a +10 boost to Fishing power when equipped. It is acquired as a <span class=\"chance\"><s>2.5*</s>1/40 (2.5%)</span> chance reward for completing a Fishing quest for the Angler NPC, depending on the number of completed quests and other factors (for details, see Angler).",
    "On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, the Angler will not give the player an Angler Earring as a reward if they already have one in their inventory or in any of their Portable Storages. However, if the player has a High Test Fishing Line, Angler Earring, <b>and</b> Tackle Box (or they have one of the accessories crafted from them, the <span class=\"eil\"><span>Angler Tackle Bag</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> or <span class=\"eil\"><span>Lavaproof Tackle Bag</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>) in their inventories, he will be able to give the player duplicate Angler Earrings.",
    "Only one Angler Earring can be equipped at a time, however the increase in fishing power stacks with that of both the Angler Tackle Bag and the Lavaproof Tackle Bag, granting a total boost of +30 if all three are equipped. Due to the aforementioned rule on duplicates for [img:Desktop version] Desktop, [img:Console version] Console, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile, it could be beneficial to keep your Angler Earring in a chest, <i>out</i> of your possessions (inventory or portable storages), while keeping the other two in, to guarantee getting a second Angler Earring as soon as possible."
