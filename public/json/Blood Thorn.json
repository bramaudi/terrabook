    "The <b>Blood Thorn</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>magic weapon</linked> that summons three penetrating Blood Thorn projectiles upon use, which erupt from solid <linked>blocks</linked> and <linked>platforms</linked> to damage <linked>enemies</linked> in a circular area around the player's cursor. Blood Thorns can pierce an unlimited number of enemies and linger for approximately 1.5 seconds before dissipating. If a solid block obstructs the line of sight between the player and the cursor, then Blood Thorn projectiles are instead summoned from a circle around the obstruction point, facing the cursor.",
    "If no solid, valid tiles are detected within a circular area around the cursor (i.e. the player is both in midair and targeting a point in midair, or when there are no valid tiles for summoning Blood Thorns around the cursor), then they are summoned from the player's hitbox instead. The Blood Thorn has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"12.5\">1/8 (12.5%)</span> chance of being dropped by the <linked>Hemogoblin Shark</linked>.",
