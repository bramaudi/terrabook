    "The <b>Phantasm Dragon</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Golem</linked> boss servant that spawns during the <linked>Lunatic Cultist</linked> <linked>boss</linked> fight. Its behavior is nearly identical to the <linked>Wyvern</linked>'s. The Lunatic Cultist summons a Phantasm Dragon when the player attacks one of the Lunatic's duplicates or takes too long to hit the real one. If the player does the above action again while a Phantasm Dragon is still alive, the Lunatic Cultist will summon an <linked>Ancient Vision</linked> instead."
