    "The <b>Phantasm Dragon</b> is a Hardmode, post-Golem boss servant that spawns during the Lunatic Cultist boss fight. Its behavior is nearly identical to the Wyvern's. The Lunatic Cultist summons a Phantasm Dragon when the player attacks one of the Lunatic's duplicates or takes too long to hit the real one. If the player does the above action again while a Phantasm Dragon is still alive, the Lunatic Cultist will summon an Ancient Vision instead."
