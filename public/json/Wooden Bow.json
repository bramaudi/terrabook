    "The <b>Wooden Bow</b> is the weakest bow in the game, dealing 4 base damage plus the damage of the arrow being fired. It is very cheap to make, and is therefore usually the first ranged weapon a player will acquire.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Demonic</b>, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> It can also get the <b>Deadly</b> modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr>."
