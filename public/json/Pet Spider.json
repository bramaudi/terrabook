    "The <b>Spider Egg</b> summons the spider Pet. It behaves exactly like the Spider AI, as it will crawl on Walls if there are any. When the player jumps high enough or outruns the spider, it will ride on a white spiderweb, as if it were standing on a wall, to keep up with the player. The Spider Egg is dropped by Pumpking during the Pumpkin Moon event."
