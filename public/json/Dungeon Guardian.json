    "The <b>Dungeon Guardian</b> is an <linked>enemy</linked> resembling <linked>Skeletron</linked>'s head. If a player enters the Dungeon in a <linked>world</linked> where <linked>Skeletron</linked> has not been defeated and travels <linked>below zero depth</linked> (the border between <linked>surface</linked> and <linked>underground</linked>), one or more Dungeon Guardians quickly fly at the player, dealing 1000 damage each, which will instantly kill most players if they are unprepared. Dungeon Guardians are large, very fast (traveling at around 41 <linked>mph</linked> in all directions), and travel through all <linked>blocks</linked>.",
    "Because of the Dungeon Guardian's high defense (9999), any player who attacks it, regardless of the <linked>weapon</linked> or other equipment (with very few exceptions), will deal only 1 damage, or 2 for <linked>critical hits</linked>. This means that the Dungeon Guardian will normally take an average of 1.04 damage. While killing a Dungeon Guardian is possible (and will award the <linked>Bone Key</linked> pet summon), it requires careful preparation. See the <linked>Tips</linked> section for setups.",
