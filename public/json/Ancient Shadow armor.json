    "<b>Ancient Shadow armor</b> is an armor set that reproduces the pre-1.0.3 Shadow armor design, and is otherwise identical in all ways to the current Shadow armor set. Each piece is interchangeable with the equivalent Shadow armor piece, while still granting the same set bonus.",
    "When the full set is equipped, the player will emit purple bubbles, and create a semi-transparent after-image effect behind themselves when moving. This effect appears to be clones of the player. These clones do not appear to have bodies inside of the armor, as there is no face prevalent.",
    "Each piece has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.19*</s>1/525 (0.19%)</span> chance of being dropped by an Eater of Souls."
