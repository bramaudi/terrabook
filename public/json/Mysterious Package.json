    "The <b>Mysterious Package</b> was an unobtainable pet summon, which was supposed to summon a pet drone that would drop a box every few minutes. It was likely intended to be available to those who bought <i><linked>Terraria</linked></i> on <linked>Amazon</linked>. It was only obtainable through hacks and was removed entirely shortly after its introduction."
