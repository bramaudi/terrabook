    "The <b>Moss Hornet</b> is a Hardmode flying enemy similar to the pre-Hardmode Hornet, being encountered in the Underground Jungle as well.",
    "Compared to the more random flying patterns of pre-Hardmode Hornets, Moss Hornets act more aggressively, hovering closer to the player's position and shooting their stingers in rapid bursts. The stingers have a <span class=\"chance\"><s>33.33*</s>1/3 (33.33%)</span> chance to inflict the Poisoned debuff to the player for 10 seconds. In <span class=\"eil\"><span>Expert Mode</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>, the chance is <span class=\"chance\"><s>33.33*</s>1/3 (33.33%)</span> for 20 seconds and <span class=\"chance\"><s>66.67*</s>2/3 (66.67%)</span> for 2â€“10 seconds. They cannot be destroyed with weapons and travel at about the same speed as the darts from a Dart Trap.",
    "Moss Hornets have a <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.67*</s>1/150 (0.67%)</span> chance to drop Tattered Bee Wing. On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, it will only drop after one Mechanical boss has been defeated in the world. It is solely used in the creation of Bee Wings."
