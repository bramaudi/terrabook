    "The <b>Tavernkeep</b> is a unique NPC vendor that accepts only Defender Medals as currency for most items, instead of coins. He will only become accessible after the player has defeated the Eater of Worlds or Brain of Cthulhu. Once this criteria is met, he will appear as an <b>Unconscious Man</b> spawning in any layer of the world. Similar to other bound NPCs, talking to him allows him to claim a house and respawn when killed.",
    "The Tavernkeep's sentry summon weapons are associated with the Old One's Army event, and at first can only be used within that event. They function elsewhere only after the event is completed once successfully. Each of the Tavernkeep's sentry summon weapons come in three tiers: rod, cane, and staff, with the staff being the most expensive and the most powerful. The armor he sells also associates each sentry type with a specific class: Ballista for melee (tank-style), Flameburst for magic, Explosive for rangers, and Lightning Aura for \"speedy melee\" (for summoners).  The Tavernkeep will give each player <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 10 / <span class=\"eico i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span> 5 Defender Medals for free. All future medals must be earned by defeating at least some waves of the Old One's Army.",
    "When threatened, he throws mugs of Ale at enemies, dealing 24 / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\">36</abbr> / <abbr class=\"master\" title=\"Master Mode\">42</abbr> damage at the start of the game, and (on the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version) as players progress he will gain various stat increases.. On all versions he may also drop an Ale Tosser upon death, allowing the player to perform the same attack.",
    "The Unconscious Man is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <span class=\"eil\"><span>Lifeform Analyzer</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> or its upgrades."
