Interacting with him in this state with <span class=\"key\"><linked>âš· Open / Activate</linked></span> will wake him. If the Unconcious Man is killed, he will still be able to respawn afterwards; if the Tavernkeep NPC is killed, he will move in again after some time as long as there are vacant <linked>houses</linked>.</li></ul>",
    "The <linked>Tavernkeep's sentry summon weapons</linked> are associated with the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> <linked>event</linked>, and at first, can only be used within that event. They function elsewhere only after the event is completed once successfully. Each of the Tavernkeep's sentry summon weapons come in three tiers: rod, cane, and staff, with the staff being the most expensive and the most powerful. The armor he sells also associates each sentry type with a specific class: Ballista for <linked>melee</linked> or tank-style users, Flameburst for <linked>magic</linked> users, Explosive Trap for <linked>rangers</linked>, and Lightning Aura for \"speedy melee\" (for <linked>summoners</linked>).",
    "When the player selects the \"<span class=\"gameText\">Eternia Crystal</span>\" option for the first time, the Tavernkeep will give the player 10 Defender Medals for free. All future Defender Medals must be earned by defeating at least some waves of the Old One's Army.",
    "The Tavernkeep throws mugs of <linked>Ale</linked> at nearby <linked>enemies</linked> to defend himself when threatened, dealing 24 / <linked>36</linked> / <linked>42</linked> damage at the start of the game. As players progress he will gain <linked>various stat increases</linked>. The Tavernkeep also has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"16.67\">1/6 (16.67%)</span> chance of dropping the <linked>Ale Tosser</linked> upon death.",
    "The Unconscious Man is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <linked>Lifeform Analyzer</linked> or its upgrades."
