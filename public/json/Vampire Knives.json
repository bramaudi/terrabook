{"type":"weapons","title":"Vampire Knives","summaries":["The <b>Vampire Knives</b> are a Hardmode post-Plantera melee weapon that autofires a spread of projectiles. When the projectile hits an enemy, a red beam will extend to the player, providing a lifesteal effect which heals the player by 7.5% of the damage dealt (rounded down). The Vampire Knives are always found inside the Dungeon's Crimson Chest in Crimson worlds. A Crimson Key will be needed to open the Crimson Chest.","Vampire Knives fire between 4 and 8 fast knife projectiles at a maximum spread of approximately 45 degrees. The projectiles are not affected by gravity, but at 28 tiles will begin to spin and fade, dissipating entirely after another 26 tiles (54 tiles total range). Melee speed bonuses will make the projectiles travel faster and farther. The projectiles may disappear visually a few tiles before they actually become ineffective. Each projectile will deal the weapon's full damage until they begin spinning and fading, at which point their damage drops gradually until they dissipate.","Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."],"statistics":{"Damage":"29 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Melee)</span>","Knockback":"2.75 <span class=\"knockback\">(Very weak)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"16 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Velocity":"15","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Rapidly throw life stealing daggers</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 8]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"20 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"200000\"><span class=\"gc\">20</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
