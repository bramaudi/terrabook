    "The <b>Vampire Knives</b> are a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>melee weapon</linked> that <linked>autofires</linked> a spread of red knife projectiles. When a knife hits an enemy, a red beam will extend to the player, providing a <linked>lifesteal</linked> effect which heals the player by 7.5% of the damage dealt (rounded down). The Vampire Knives fire between 4 and 8 high-velocity (~84 mph) knife projectiles at a maximum spread of approximately 45Â°. The projectiles are not affected by gravity, but at 28 tiles will begin to spin and fade, dissipating entirely after another 26 tiles (54 tiles total range). <linked>Melee speed</linked> bonuses will make the projectiles travel faster and farther. The projectiles may disappear visually a few tiles before they actually become ineffective. Each knife projectile will deal the weapon's full damage until it begins spinning and fading, at which point its damage drops gradually until it dissipates. The Vampire Knives are always found in the <linked>Dungeon</linked>'s <linked>Crimson Chest</linked>, which can only be unlocked with a <linked>Crimson Key</linked> after Plantera has been defeated.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
