    "The <b>Raven Staff</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>summon weapon</linked> that spawns a <b>Raven</b> <linked>minion</linked> that swiftly charges through <linked>enemies</linked> while dealing contact damage. Like other <linked>minions</linked>, the summoned Raven is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the <linked>buff</linked>, or leaves the world. The Raven Staff is dropped by the <linked>Pumpking</linked> during the <linked>Pumpkin Moon</linked> <linked>event</linked> with a 1.56–12.5% (<linked>6.25–12.5%</linked>) chance depending on the current wave.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal <linked>critical hits</linked>. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Raven Staff has over a Ruthless one is <linked>knockback</linked>."
