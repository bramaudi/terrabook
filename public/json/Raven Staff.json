    "The <b>Raven Staff</b> is a Hardmode, post-Plantera summon weapon. It spawns a Raven minion that chases enemies and deals contact damage. Like other minions, the summoned Ravens is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. It is dropped from Pumpking during the Pumpkin Moon event with a chance of 1.79% â€“ 14.29%, depending on the wave.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Raven Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback."
