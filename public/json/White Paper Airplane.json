    "The <b>Paper Airplane</b> and <b>White Paper Airplane</b> are consumable <linked>ranged weapons</linked>. When thrown, they will travel in a different path each time, as they are affected by <linked>wind</linked> speed and direction, which is especially apparent on a <linked>Windy Day</linked>. The two variants are functionally identical. They are sometimes dropped by <linked>slimes</linked> that are carried by <linked>Windy Balloons</linked>, which can spawn during a Windy Day.",
    "Unlike other consumable ranged weapons, Paper Airplanes always drop as an item when flying for too long, hitting a block, or hitting an enemy."
