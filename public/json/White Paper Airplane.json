{"type":"weapons","title":"Paper Airplanes","summaries":["The <b>Paper Airplane</b> and <b>White Paper Airplane</b> are consumable ranged weapons. When thrown, they will travel in a different path each time, as they are affected by wind speed and direction. This is especially apparent on a Windy Day. They are sometimes dropped by slimes that are carried by Windy Balloons, which can spawn during a Windy Day.","Unlike other consumable ranged weapons, Paper Airplanes always drop as an item when flying for too long, hitting a block, or hitting an enemy.","Due to their extremely low damage and rarity, they are not really a practical weapon, more a novelty item similar to the kites."],"statistics":{"Damage":"4 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Ranged)</span>","Knockback":"2 <span class=\"knockback\">(Very weak)</span>","Consumable":"<span class=\"t-yes\">✔️</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"17 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Velocity":"5","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 0]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"10 Silver Coins\" data-sort-value=\"1000\"><span class=\"sc\">10</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
