The star lingers in midair for 100 ticks (1.67 seconds) before dissipating, while its secondary ornament projectiles travel for 50 ticks (0.83 seconds) before dropping directly downwards. The first and third ornaments will be released to the right (in the direction of flight) and the second and fourth to the left. Since each consecutive ornament has slightly less range, the five projectiles usually align in a roughly triangular shape. Ornament projectiles break upon contact with <linked>enemies</linked> and solid <linked>blocks</linked> and deal 100% of the weapon's base damage (86 damage). While the primary star ornament inflicts the weapon's base <linked>knockback</linked>, colored ornaments only inflict a quarter of its knockback (1.75 <span class=\"knockback\">(Very weak)</span>).</li><li>On the <linked>[img:Old-gen console version]</linked><linked> Old-gen console version</linked> and <linked>Nintendo 3DS</linked><linked>[img:Nintendo 3DS version]</linked><linked> version</linked>, swinging the Christmas Tree Sword launches a single ornament in the direction of the cursor which is affected by gravity.
