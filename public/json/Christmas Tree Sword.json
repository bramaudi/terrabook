    "The <b>Christmas Tree Sword</b> is a Hardmode sword that fires ornament projectiles when swung. It has a chance to drop from Everscreams during the Frost Moon event.",
    "On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, swinging the Christmas Tree Sword hurls a star ornament projectile in a straight line in the direction of the cursor which releases four randomly colored ornaments on its way. These ornaments move a few tiles, linger in the air for 50 ticks (0.83 seconds), and then become affected by gravity and drop to the ground. They break upon contact with enemies or blocks. All projectiles deal 75% of the sword's damage (64 base damage), and the colored ornaments only inflict a quarter of the sword's knockback (1.75, or very weak).",
    "On the [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console version, Nintendo 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version] version, and [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader version, swinging the Christmas Tree Sword launches a single ornament in the direction of the cursor which is affected by gravity.
