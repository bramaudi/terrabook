    "The <b>Amber Horseshoe Balloon</b> is an accessory that increases jump height by 75% (6 blocks → 10.5 blocks), reduces it by 15% when underwater (8 blocks → 7 blocks), makes the player immune to fall damage, and releases bees when attacked, which seek out and damage enemies. It can be crafted at a Tinkerer's Workshop with a Lucky Horseshoe and a Honey Balloon. On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, it also grants the Honey buff after being damaged."
