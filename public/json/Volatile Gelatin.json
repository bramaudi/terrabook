    "The <b>Volatile Gelatin</b> is an <linked>accessory</linked> obtained from <linked>Queen Slime</linked>'s <linked>Treasure Bag</linked> in <linked>Expert Mode</linked>. When equipped, it periodically fires a small, bouncing, purple projectile, similar to those of the Queen Slime, at a nearby <linked>enemy</linked>. The projectile deals 65 damage and a knockback of 7 (Strong); these values are unaffected by any boosts. It pierces up to three enemies.",
    "The accessory has a fixed cycle: Once every 0.833 seconds (50 ticks), it attempts to release a projectile in the direction of the nearest enemy. If there is no enemy within 40 tiles, no projectile will be fired and the accessory will go on cooldown for the following 50 ticks."
