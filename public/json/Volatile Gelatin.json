The Volatile Gelatin's projectiles can pierce up to three enemies or ricochet up to three times, and deal 65 classless damage while inflicting a knockback value of 7 <span class=\"knockback\">(Strong)</span>; these values are unaffected by any boosts.",
    "The accessory has a fixed cycle: Once every 0.833 seconds (50 ticks), it attempts to release a projectile in the direction of the nearest enemy. If there is no enemy within 40 tiles, no projectile will be fired and the accessory will go on cooldown for the following 50 ticks."
