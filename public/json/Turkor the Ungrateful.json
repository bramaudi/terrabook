    "<b>Turkor the Ungrateful</b> is a <linked>pre-Hardmode</linked> <linked>boss</linked> which can be summoned only during the <linked>Thanksgiving</linked> season (November 1â€“30). His body appears to be a cooked turkey on a plate, and his head is attached by a long, flexible spine. The head must be destroyed first, otherwise the body will have high enough defense to render most pre-Hardmode weapons useless. Once the head is destroyed, the body's defense lowers for 25 seconds, after which more heads grow.",
    "While Turkor the Ungrateful is alive, the music Boss 1 will play."

Turkor the Ungrateful can only be summoned during the Thanksgiving season. If one attempts to summon him outside of the thanksgiving season, the stuffing and feather will be consumed, but the boss will not be summoned.</p>"
