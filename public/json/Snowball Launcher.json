Once placed, clicking <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚒ Use / Attack</linked></span> on it will fire a single Snowball and holding the key will release a rapid fire of snowballs, with a spread of roughly 30°.

    "Similar to the <linked>Cannon</linked>, the Snowball Launcher can also be triggered by <linked>wire</linked>. Depending on the lateral position of the connected wire within the sprite of the Snowball Launcher, it will either shoot a snowball (with a cooldown of 1/6th of a second) or turn to the side the wire is on. Snowballs fired by activating the Snowball Launcher via wire are purely cosmetic, deal no damage, and are not consumed from the player's inventory."
