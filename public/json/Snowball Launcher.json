    "The <b>Snowball Launcher</b> is a pre-Hardmode placeable weapon which uses Snowballs as ammunition. Once placed, clicking <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Left Click (PC default): Use held item or attack\">⚒ Use / Attack</span></kbd></span> on it will fire a single Snowball and holding the key will release a rapid fire of snowballs, with a spread of roughly thirty degrees. It can be dropped from the Snow Flinx in the Ice biome with a chance of <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.67*</s>1/150 (0.67%)</span>.",
    "Similar to the Cannon, the Snowball Launcher can also be triggered by wire. Depending on the lateral position of the connected wire within the sprite of the Snowball Launcher, it will either shoot a snowball (with a cooldown of 1/6th of a second) or turn to the side the wire is on. Snowballs fired by activating the Snowball Launcher via wire are purely cosmetic, deal no damage, and are not consumed from the player's inventory."
