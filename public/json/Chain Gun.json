The Chain Gun is dropped by <linked>Santa-NK1</linked> during the <linked>Frost Moon</linked> <linked>event</linked> with a 5.55%–12.5% / <linked>12.5%–50%</linked> chance depending on the current wave.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Rapid</b>. However, <b>Godly</b> may be preferred to save ammo. Due to its low use time, it can only gain modifiers that give a speed boost of 15%, thus cannot have the <b>Unreal</b> modifier."
