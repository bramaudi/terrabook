    "The <b>Dark Mage's Tome</b> is a <linked>mount</linked>-summon item that places the player on a <b>Book Mount</b> similar to the one ridden by the <linked>Dark Mage</linked> during the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> event. It is dropped by the Dark Mage in <linked>Master Mode</linked> only.",
    "The mount allows a player to hover and glide at a fixed height of 8 tiles high in mid-air for 5 seconds following a jump or walking off a ledge. It otherwise glides along the ground. Whether on the ground or hovering, its top speed is <abbr title=\"41 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 30 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">41 mph</span></abbr>.",
    "The max height of the mount can be increased using items that allow for multiple jumps such as the <linked>Cloud in a Bottle</linked>, though this only allows it to be multiplied by the number of times the player jumps. The altitude of the mount is also adjustable in the down direction by pressing <span class=\"key\"><linked>â–¼ Down</linked></span>.",
