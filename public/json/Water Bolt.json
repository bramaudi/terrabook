    "The <b>Water Bolt</b> is a pre-Hardmode magic weapon that auto-fires a slow, blue, ricocheting water-ball projectile that travels in straight lines, emits a dim light, is unaffected by gravity, and pierces multiple enemies. The projectile can last up to 30 seconds, but it will dissipate when it ricochets 5 times or damages 10 enemies. The Water Bolt is uniquely found only in the Dungeon, hidden as one of the many Books on the shelves. It cannot be crafted, purchased, found in Chests, or obtained in other ways.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Mythical</b>."
