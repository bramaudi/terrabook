    "The <b>Hammush</b> is a Hardmode hammer that is purchased from the Truffle for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"40 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"400000\"><span class=\"gc\">40</span></span> after at least one mechanical boss has been defeated. When swung, the Hammush produces spinning mushrooms like that of the Mushroom Spear, which hurt enemies, even through walls. Like the Pwnhammer (and higher-tier hammers), it can also be used to destroy Altars, and shares its tooltip.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>. While <b>Light</b> may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool."
