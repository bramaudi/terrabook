    "The <b>Possessed Hatchet</b> is a Hardmode, post-Golem boomerang-type melee weapon that flies very fast and homes in on enemies, then returns to the player. It also emits a certain amount of light when thrown. It has a <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> <span class=\"chance\"><s>14.29*</s>1/7 (14.29%)</span> / <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> <span class=\"chance\"><s>12.5*</s>1/8 (12.5%)</span> chance to be dropped from the Golem.",
    "On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, and [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader version, the weapon acts similarly to stacked Light Discs, capable of throwing out multiple hatchets even though the weapon cannot stack, with no limit to the number of hatchets that can be out at once. On the [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console version and Nintendo 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version] version, it acts as a singular boomerang, only firing one at a time. When it has no enemy to home in on, the Hatchet returns to the player after flying a relatively short distance of only 25 tiles.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
