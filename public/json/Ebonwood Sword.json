    "The <b>Ebonwood Sword</b> is an alternate version of the Wooden Sword made using Ebonwood from the Corruption Biome. It is functionally identical to its Crimson equivalent, the Shadewood Sword, with both dealing more damage and having slightly increased speed than the Wooden Sword and its variants (aside from the hardmode Pearlwood Sword). With it being stronger than the other wooden swords, it can be useful early on, though one should proceed with caution, as the Corruption is a very dangerous place for new players.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>."
