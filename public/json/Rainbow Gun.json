    "The <b>Rainbow Gun</b> is a Hardmode, post-Plantera magic weapon. It launches a rainbow that travels in a straight line for a short distance before curving downwards. The rainbow persists for <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 40 / <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 20 seconds or until another rainbow is fired. Enemies touching it take damage repeatedly, approximately five times per second. The Rainbow Gun is found in the Dungeon's Hallowed Chest, which must be unlocked with a Hallowed Key.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The <b>Mythical</b> modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but the only stats that improve damage output are damage and critical chance. Switching to a different magic weapon causes existing projectiles to use that weapon's critical chance instead, meaning that the Rainbow Gun's <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr> is optimized with the Ruthless modifier when used in the intended way."
