    "The <b>Antlion</b> is an <linked>enemy</linked> found in <linked>Deserts</linked> during the day and in <linked>Underground Deserts</linked>. It remains stationary with its head sticking out of the ground, and will shoot <linked>sand</linked> projectiles at the player every 3.33 seconds when they are in its line of sight. It can only launch its projectile at an upwards angle (within about 45 degrees to the left and right), so players approaching from lower ground are usually out of its line of fire. The sand projectiles turn into clumps of Sand Blocks when hitting an object, and will gather on the ground, similarly to the projectiles fired by the <linked>Sandgun</linked>.",
