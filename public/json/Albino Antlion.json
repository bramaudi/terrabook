    "The <b>Antlion</b> is an <linked>enemy</linked> found in <linked>Deserts</linked> during the day and in <linked>Underground Deserts</linked>. It remains stationary with its head sticking out of the ground, turns its head towards the player when they are within its line of sight, and fires Sand Ball projectiles at them once every 3.33 seconds. It can only launch its projectiles at an upward angle (within about 45Â° to the left and right), so players that are approaching from lower ground are usually out of its line of fire. Sand Balls turn into <linked>Sand Blocks</linked> upon hitting an object, and will gather on the ground, similarly to the projectiles fired by the <linked>Sandgun</linked>.",
