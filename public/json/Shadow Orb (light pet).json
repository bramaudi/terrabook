    "The <b>Shadow Orb</b> is a light pet item that summons a slow-moving <b>Shadow Orb</b> which follows the player around and emits dim, purple light. The orb can move through solid objects and liquids unhindered, but moves very slowly, causing it to fall behind when the player is moving quickly. If it falls far enough behind, it will teleport to the player's location. It has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>20*</s>1/5 (20%)</span> chance of dropping from destroyed Shadow Orbs, but it can also be acquired by looting <span class=\"eil\"><span>Corrupt Crates</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>, which are obtained by fishing in the Corruption.",
