It looks similar to the Blowpipe, but has a red ribbon on the top and is flared on one end, and is used by the Witch Doctor to defend himself.",
    "It can shoot Seeds, Poison Darts, Cursed Darts, Ichor Darts and Crystal Darts. Carrying a Blowgun in the inventory causes any vegetation growing on normal grass blocks to occasionally yield some Seeds when destroyed. Flowers growing in Clay Pots and Planter Boxes can also yield Seeds. Both wild and cultivated flowers typically drop 4 Seeds at a time. Long grass typically drops 1-2 Seeds.",
