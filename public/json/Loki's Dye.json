    "<b>Loki's Dye</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>dye</linked> that can be obtained from Hardmode <linked>bosses</linked>' <linked>Treasure Bags</linked> (except <linked>Queen Slime</linked>'s), as part of <linked>Loki's set</linked>. It does not change the color of the armor, but rather adds a dark gray flames effect, similar to <linked>four other dyes</linked> which are obtained by trading <linked>Strange Plants</linked> with the <linked>Dye Trader</linked> in <linked>Hardmode</linked>. Equipping Loki's Dye in all 3 dye slots intensifies the effect. It also makes the item in whatever slot itâ€™s in glow in the dark."
