    "The <b>Slice of Cake</b> is a <linked>furniture</linked> item acquired by being the first player to talk to the <linked>Party Girl</linked> during a <linked>Party</linked> that occurred by random chance at <linked>dawn</linked> (player-initiated Parties will not cause her to give players the Slice of Cake).",
    "Placing and pressing <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚷ Open / Activate</linked></span> on the Slice of Cake grants the <b>Sugar Rush</b> <linked>buff</linked>, which grants +20% <linked>movement speed</linked> and +20% <linked>mining speed</linked>. This lasts for 2 minutes, but can be canceled at any time  by right-clicking the icon (<linked>[img:Desktop version]</linked>),  by selecting the icon and canceling it in the equipment menu (<linked>[img:Console version]</linked>), or  by double-tapping the buff icon (<linked>[img:Mobile version]</linked>).",
    "Unlike <linked>equipment buff items</linked>, the Slice of Cake must be placed in order to activate the buff. It can be mined with a <linked>pickaxe</linked> or <linked>drill</linked> and picked up again, even while the buff is active, which will not cancel the buff. Placement is only dependent on an adequate space of 2×2 tiles being available."
