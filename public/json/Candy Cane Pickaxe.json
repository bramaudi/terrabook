    "The <b>Candy Cane Pickaxe</b> is a third-tier pickaxe that has the same pickaxe power as the Gold Pickaxe, and therefore is capable of mining Demonite and Crimtane Ores. It is obtained from Presents dropped during the Christmas event, with a chance of 0.634% in pre-Hardmode and 0.592% in Hardmode. It has the same mining speed as the Gold Pickaxe, therefore it is a good replacement of all pickaxes below Platinum Pickaxe with the exception of the Bone Pickaxe.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>. While <b>Light</b> may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool."
