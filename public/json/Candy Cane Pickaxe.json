    "The <b>Candy Cane Pickaxe</b> is a third-tier <linked>pickaxe</linked> that has the same <linked>pickaxe power</linked> as the <linked>Gold Pickaxe</linked>, and therefore is capable of mining <linked>Demonite</linked> and <linked>Crimtane Ore</linked>. It is obtained from <linked>Presents</linked> dropped during the <linked>Christmas</linked> event, with a chance of 0.634% in <linked>pre-Hardmode</linked> and 0.592% in <linked>Hardmode</linked>. It has the same <linked>mining speed</linked> as the Gold Pickaxe, therefore it is a good replacement of all pickaxes below <linked>Platinum Pickaxe</linked> with the exception of the <linked>Bone Pickaxe</linked>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Legendary</b>. While <b>Light</b> may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light <linked>mine at equal speeds</linked> for this tool."
