    "The <b>Tally Counter</b> is an <linked>informational accessory</linked> which displays how many <linked>enemies</linked> of a type have been killed. The Tally Counter will first display <i>\"<span class=\"gameText\">Kill count unavailable</span>\"</i> underneath the <linked>map</linked>/<linked>health</linked> area and, after an enemy has been attacked, the text will display how many times that enemy has ever been killed by all players combined in that world. The kill count will only display the last enemy struck by the player or their <linked>minions</linked>. It will count deaths from world creation rather than from when it was equipped. The Tally Counter has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"1\">1/100 (1%)</span> chance of being dropped from <linked>Angry Bones</linked>, <linked>Cursed Skulls</linked>, and <linked>Dark Casters</linked>, all of which are found in the <linked>Dungeon</linked>.",
    "The Tally Counter is one of the three parts necessary to make the <linked>R.E.K. 3000</linked>, with the others being the <linked>Lifeform Analyzer</linked> and the <linked>Radar</linked>, and as such is a required ingredient in <linked>crafting</linked> the <linked>Shellphone</linked>."
