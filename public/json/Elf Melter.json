    "The <b>Elf Melter</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>ranged weapon</linked> that can be considered an indirect post-<linked>Plantera</linked> upgrade to the <linked>Flamethrower</linked>, as it also uses <linked>Gel</linked> for <linked>ammunition</linked>. Similar to its predecessor, every press of the <span class=\"key\"><linked>âš’ Use / Attack</linked></span> button consumes <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span> 1 / <span class=\"eico i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Old-gen console and 3DS versions)</span></span> 2 Gel and generates <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span> five / <span class=\"eico i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Old-gen console and 3DS versions)</span></span> six bursts of fire in quick succession that can be spread over an area by moving the cursor while firing. The Elf Melter is dropped from <linked>Santa-NK1</linked> during the <linked>Frost Moon</linked> <linked>event</linked> with a 5.5% ~ 12.5% (<linked>12.5% ~ 50%</linked>) chance depending on the current wave.",
    "On the <linked>[img:Desktop version]</linked><linked> Desktop version</linked>, <linked>[img:Console version]</linked><linked> Console version</linked>, and <linked>[img:Mobile version]</linked><linked> Mobile version</linked>, the Elf Melter's fire bursts possess unique blue graphics and fly out of the weapon at a high velocity while expanding with time, before disappearing a short distance ahead of the player, creating a cone-like area of effect. The fire has 15 <linked>armor penetration</linked>, inflicts the <linked>Frostbite</linked> debuff for 20 seconds, and can pierce through three enemies before dissipating upon hitting a fourth. Additionally, the flame projectile's damage decreases by 15% for each enemy it pierces.",

The fire inflicts the <linked>On Fire!</linked> debuff for 20 seconds and can pierce through three enemies before dissipating upon hitting a fourth.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Unreal</b>.

A modifier with added velocity will increase the range of each stream, i.e. by about 5 tiles for +15% and about 3 tiles for +10%."
