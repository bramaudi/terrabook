The fire has 15 armor penetration, inflicts the Frostbite debuff for 20 seconds, and can pierce through three enemies before dissipating upon hitting a fourth. Additionally, the projectile's damage decreases by 15% for each enemy it pierces.","On the [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console version, Nintendo 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version] version, and [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader version, the Elf Melter's bursts are straight lines of fire particles, which travel out from the weapon to a short distance ahead of the player before stopping, lingering briefly. The fire inflicts the On Fire! debuff for 20 seconds, and can pierce through three enemies before dissipating upon hitting a fourth.","Its best modifier is <b>Unreal</b>.
