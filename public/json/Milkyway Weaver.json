    "The <b>Milkyway Weaver</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Lunatic Cultist</linked>, <linked>worm</linked> <linked>enemy</linked> spawned by the <linked>Stardust Pillar</linked> during the <linked>Lunar Events</linked>. It is similar to the <linked>Solar Pillar</linked>'s <linked>Crawltipede</linked>, in that it is completely unaffected by gravity and floats freely through the air. However, it is much smaller than the Crawltipede, targets players anywhere instead of only in the air, and rather than its tail, its head is its only vulnerable part. Occasionally, it stops to charge for a few seconds, then summon another enemy affiliated with the Stardust Pillar."
