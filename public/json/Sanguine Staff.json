    "The <b>Sanguine Staff</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>summon weapon</linked> that summons a <b>Sanguine Bat</b> minion that remains by the player's side until an <linked>enemy</linked> is in sight, and attacks by flying in an elliptical loop between the player and enemy. The Sanguine Bats arrange themselves along a semicircle with the player's head as the center, and immediately return to the player's side once their target dies. The Sanguine Staff has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"50\">1/2 (50%)</span> / <linked>1/1 (100%)</linked> chance of being dropped by the <linked>Dreadnautilus</linked>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal <linked>critical hits</linked>. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Sanguine Staff has over a Ruthless one is <linked>knockback</linked>."
