    "The <b>Pearlwood Bow</b> is a Hardmode bow crafted using Pearlwood. It is the strongest wooden bow in the game, however, is weaker than most pre-hardmode bows, and as the player will likely have a better bow already, this bow is mostly useless.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Demonic</b>, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> It can also get the <b>Deadly</b> modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr>."
