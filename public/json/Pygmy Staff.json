    "The Pygmy Staff is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>summon weapon</linked> that spawns a <b>Pygmy</b> <linked>minion</linked>, which attacks by throwing long-ranged spears aimed at nearby enemies at a rate of twice per second. Pygmy Spears break upon contact with an enemy or solid block, and, on the <linked>[img:Desktop version]</linked><linked> Desktop version</linked>, <linked>[img:Console version]</linked><linked> Console version</linked>, and <linked>[img:Mobile version]</linked><linked> Mobile version</linked>, also inflict the <linked>Acid Venom</linked> <linked>debuff</linked> for a 5â€“10 second duration. Like other <linked>minions</linked>, summoned Pygmies are invincible and follow the player indefinitely or until the player dies, summons a different minion, cancels the <linked>buff</linked>, or leaves the world. The Pygmy Staff has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>25*</s>1/4 (25%)</span> / <linked>50*1/2 (50%)</linked> chance of being dropped by <linked>Plantera</linked>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal <linked>critical hits</linked>. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Pygmy Staff has over a Ruthless one is <linked>knockback</linked>."
