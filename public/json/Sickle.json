    "The <b>Sickle</b> is a tool that produces Hay blocks when used to cut tall grass. The collected Hay can be used for building purposes and crafted into Target Dummies and Hay Walls. Due to its comparably potent damage-dealing capabilities (only slightly inferior to the Tin Broadsword) and its ability to autoswing, it can also be used as a melee weapon in the very early game.",
    "The Sickle is purchased from the Merchant for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"60 Silver Coins\" data-sort-value=\"6000\"><span class=\"sc\">60</span></span>. On the [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console version and Nintendo 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version] version, it is only available during the Halloween season.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Light</b> for harvesting purposes and <b>Legendary</b> for combat purposes."
