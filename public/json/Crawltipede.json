    "The <b>Crawltipede</b> is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist, worm enemy which spawns in Solar Pillar area during the Lunar Events. Uniquely, it has no visible health bar, and its tail is the only segment that is vulnerable to attacks, which takes 10 times damage. It flies directly at airborne players and deals high damage, while ignoring players on the ground.",
    "Crawltipedes' primary role seems to be forcing the player to stay near the ground, opening them up to melee attacks from the other Solar Pillar enemies."
