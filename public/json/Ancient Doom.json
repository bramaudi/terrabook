    "<b>Ancient Doom</b> is one of the <linked>Lunatic Cultist</linked>'s attacks in <linked>Expert Mode</linked> and <linked>Master Mode</linked>. It will only appear when the boss is at relatively low health (less than 50%). A short time after creation or upon death, the Ancient Doom will burst and send slow-moving \"Prophecy's End\" projectiles in all four cardinal directions. These projectiles pierce and cannot be destroyed by weapons, and they deal significantly high amounts of damage, especially in Master Mode."
