    "The <b>Gelatinous Pillion</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>mount</linked>-summoning item. When used, it summons a friendly <b>Winged Slime Mount</b>. Similar to the pre-Hardmode <linked>Slime Mount</linked>, the Winged Slime offers increased jump height, provides boosted movement speed, negates fall damage, and allows continuous auto-jump by holding the <span class=\"key\"><linked>↷ Jump</linked></span> key. It also shares the Slime Mount's abilities to deal 40 <linked>summon damage</linked> to enemies when jumping on them from above, and floating when entering <linked>liquids</linked>.",
    "The Winged Slime Mount grants 2.66 seconds of flight time, similar to low-tier <linked>wings</linked>, allowing the player to fly up to a height of 73 tiles, as well as gliding while holding the <span class=\"key\"><linked>↷ Jump</linked></span> key after flight time has been exhausted. It can also hover by holding <span class=\"key\"><linked>▼ Down</linked></span>, similar to the <linked>Hoverboard</linked>.",
    "The Gelatinous Pillion has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>25*</s>1/4 (25%)</span> chance of being dropped by <linked>Queen Slime</linked> in <linked>Classic Mode</linked>, or a <linked>50*1/2 (50%)</linked> chance of being found in <linked>Queen Slime's Treasure Bag</linked>."
