    "The <b>Cascade</b> is a pre-Hardmode yoyo. With a base reach of 15.5 tiles and a maximum spin duration of 16 seconds before returning, it is the most powerful yoyo available pre-Hardmode. Upon striking an enemy, it has a chance to inflict the On Fire! debuff.",
    "The Cascade has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.25*</s>1/400 (0.25%)</span> chance of being dropped by any enemy in or near The Underworld after Skeletron has been defeated. Once Hardmode begins, it will no longer drop, as the stronger Hel-Fire will drop instead.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
