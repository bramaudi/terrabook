{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Prismatic Lacewing","summaries":["The <b>Prismatic Lacewing</b> is a rare flying critter that spawns in the surface Hallow from dusk until midnight after Plantera has been defeated. When killed by a player, it summons the Empress of Light; death from non-player sources other than Fallen Stars will not result in summoning.","The Prismatic Lacewing can be caught with a Bug Net. Releasing it from the inventory (with <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Left Click (PC default): Use held item or attack\">⚒ Use / Attack</span></kbd></span>) and killing it will still summon the Empress of Light (though it will quickly disappear if released outside of the Hallow). Only one Lacewing can be naturally spawned at a time. Because it can only spawn between dusk and midnight, its spawn is limited to between the times of 7:30 PM and 12:00 AM. It can also be used to craft a Prismatic Lacewing Jar.","It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <span class=\"eil\"><span>Lifeform Analyzer</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> or its upgrades."],"statistics":{"Consumable":"<span class=\"t-yes\">✔️</span>","Use time":"15 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">'Its wings are so delicate, you must be careful not to damage it...'</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 3]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"50000\"><span class=\"gc\">5</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">3 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{"Used in":[{"result":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i multi-line\">[img:Prismatic Lacewing Jar]<span><span>Prismatic Lacewing Jar</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span>"},"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Bottle]<span><span>Bottle</span></span></span></li><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Prismatic Lacewing]<span><span>Prismatic Lacewing</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span></li></ul>"},"station":{"rowspan":1,"value":"By Hand"}}]}}
