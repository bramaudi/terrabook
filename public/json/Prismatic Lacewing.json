    "The <b>Prismatic Lacewing</b> is a rare flying <linked>critter</linked> that spawns in the surface <linked>Hallow</linked> after <linked>Plantera</linked> has been defeated. It only spawns between dusk (7:30 PM) and midnight (12:00 AM). When killed by a player, it summons the <linked>Empress of Light</linked>; death from non-player sources will generally not result in summoning. Only one Lacewing can be naturally spawned at a time.",
    "The Prismatic Lacewing can be caught with a <linked>Bug Net</linked>. Releasing it from the inventory (with <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚒ Use / Attack</linked></span>) and killing it will still summon the Empress of Light.",
    "It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <linked>Lifeform Analyzer</linked> or its upgrades."
