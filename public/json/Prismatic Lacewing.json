{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Prismatic Lacewing","summaries":["The <b>Prismatic Lacewing</b> is a rare flying <linked>critter</linked> that spawns in the surface <linked>Hallow</linked> from dusk until midnight after <linked>Plantera</linked> has been defeated. When killed by a player, it summons the <linked>Empress of Light</linked>; death from non-player sources other than Fallen Stars will not result in summoning.","The Prismatic Lacewing can be caught with a <linked>Bug Net</linked>. Releasing it from the inventory (with <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚒ Use / Attack</linked></span>) and killing it will still summon the <linked>Empress of Light</linked> (though it will quickly disappear if released outside of the Hallow). Only one Lacewing can be naturally spawned at a time. Because it can only spawn between dusk and midnight, its spawn is limited to between the times of 7:30 PM and 12:00 AM. It can also be used to craft a <linked>Prismatic Lacewing Jar</linked>.","It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <span class=\"eil\"><span><linked>Lifeform Analyzer</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> or its upgrades."],"statistics":{"Consumable":"<span class=\"t-yes\">✔️</span>","Use time":"15 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">'Its wings are so delicate, you must be careful not to damage it...'</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\"><linked>[img:Rarity level: 3]</linked></span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"50000\"><span class=\"gc\">5</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">3 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{"Used in":[{"result":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i multi-line\"><linked>[img:Prismatic Lacewing Jar]</linked><span><span><linked>Prismatic Lacewing Jar</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span>"},"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Bottle]</linked><span><span><linked>Bottle</linked></span></span></span></li><li><span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Prismatic Lacewing]</linked><span><span><linked>Prismatic Lacewing</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span></li></ul>"},"station":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<linked>By Hand</linked>"}}]}}
