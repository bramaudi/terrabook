    "The <b>Raincoat Zombie</b> is a zombie variant that only appears during the Rain on the surface at Night. It acts the same as normal zombies, slowly walking towards the player to deal contact damage, while attempting to navigate around obstacles and only being able to open doors during a Blood Moon. It is differentiated from other zombies in that it is dressed in traditional yellow raincoat attire, which it can also drop in the form of the Rain Hat and Rain Coat armor pieces.",
    "Raincoat Zombies can appear in three different size variations with slightly different stats. Unlike normal zombies, it does not have Armed variation in Expert Mode."
