    "The <b>Sleepy Octopod</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>melee weapon</linked> that is swung continuously in a 360° radius around the player when used. After swinging the Sleepy Octopod for about 1 second, green particles appear at the tip of the weapon, signifying that it is ready to deliver its secondary attack: If the head hits a <linked>block</linked> at the end of the swing, it causes a 3×12-tile tall explosion. Between explosions, the Sleepy Octopod acts as a swung melee weapon, dealing regular damage to <linked>enemies</linked> that make contact with the staff.",
    "The explosion deals triple damage and will damage enemies through blocks. Because of the distance that the head is at when the swing finishes, the explosion will not hit enemies closer than two blocks from the player, though the weapon itself will hit these enemies, dealing regular damage. The Sleepy Octopod is dropped by <linked>Ogres</linked> during the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> <linked>event</linked>, with a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"10\">1/10 (10%)</span> / <linked>1/5 (20%)</linked> chance during Tier 2, and a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"5\">1/20 (5%)</span> chance during Tier 3.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
