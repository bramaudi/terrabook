After swinging the Sleepy Octopod for about 1 second, green particles appear at the tip of the weapon, signifying that it is ready to deliver its secondary attack: If the head hits a <linked>block</linked> at the end of the swing, it causes a 3 by 12-tile explosion. Between explosions, it acts as a swung melee weapon, dealing regular damage on contact with <linked>enemies</linked>.","The explosion deals triple damage and will damage enemies through blocks. Because of the distance that the head is at when the swing finishes, the explosion will not hit enemies closer than two blocks from the player, though the weapon itself will hit these enemies, dealing regular damage.","Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."],"statistics":{"Damage":"50 <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / 40 <span class=\"eico s i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span> <span class=\"small-bold\">(Melee)</span>","Knockback":"7 <span class=\"knockback\">(Strong)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"30 <span class=\"usetime\">(Average)</span>","Velocity":"24","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Charges power as it is swung to smash enemies</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\"><linked>[img:Rarity level: 5]</linked></span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Gold Coin\" data-sort-value=\"10000\"><span class=\"gc\">1</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
