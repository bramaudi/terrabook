    "The <b>White Horseshoe Balloon</b> is an accessory that grants immunity to fall damage, increases jump height by 33% and jump speed by 30%, and grants a double-jump. The height of the first jump is increased from 6 blocks to 10½ blocks (~75% increase), while the double-jump's height is increased from 8 blocks to 14½ blocks, reaching a total of 25 blocks with both jumps.",
    "Jump height is oddly <i>reduced</i> when underwater, reducing your total underwater height from 19 blocks (8 + 11 from Blizzard jump) to 16 blocks (7 + 9 from Blizzard jump)."
