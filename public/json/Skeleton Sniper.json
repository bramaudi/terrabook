    "The <b>Skeleton Sniper</b> is a rare post-<linked>Plantera</linked>, <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>Dungeon</linked> <linked>enemy</linked> that attacks from long range. A Skeleton Sniper approaches a targeted player slowly and, as soon as it has a clear line-of-sight to the player, pauses briefly before firing a single shot. This shot can be fired from offscreen, and deals enough damage to kill a player with maximum health in three hits (two in Expert mode, one in Master mode).",
    "It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <span class=\"eil\"><span><linked>Lifeform Analyzer</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> or its upgrades.",
    "The Skeleton Sniper spawns most often in areas of the Dungeon backed by <linked>Slab Walls</linked>, along with <linked>Rusty Armored Bones</linked> and <linked>Ragged Casters</linked>. Removing these naturally occurring back walls will prevent these enemies from spawning, but they cannot be replaced to spawn these enemies elsewhere. These areas can further be identified by the presence of <linked>Ragged Brotherhood Sigils</linked> and <linked>Rusted Company Standards</linked>, but these banners are purely indicative and do not influence spawning."
