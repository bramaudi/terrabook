    "The <b>Spore Zombie</b> is a zombie variant that only appears in Surface Glowing Mushroom biomes at any point in the game. It acts the same as normal zombies, slowly walking towards the player to deal contact damage, while attempting to navigate around obstacles. However, it is differentiable by normal zombies due to its mushroom-covered appearance, spawning at any time of day, and generally more powerful stats. Unlike normal zombies, it is always able to open doors regardless of whether or not it is a Blood Moon.",
