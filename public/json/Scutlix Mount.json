    "The <b>Brain Scrambler</b> is a <linked>mount</linked>-summon item that summons a rideable <b>Scutlix Mount</b>. It has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>3.33*</s>1/30 (3.33%)</span> chance to drop from the <linked>Scutlix Gunner</linked> during the <linked>Martian Madness</linked> event.",
    "The Scutlix Mount offers increased acceleration and land speed (41 <linked>mph</linked> top speed), increased jump height (20 tiles/40 feet), and its eyes automatically rapid-fire damaging lasers at <linked>enemies</linked>. It also reduces <linked>fall damage</linked> to 1.",
    "Its lasers deal about 150 classless damage each (both fire each time and are accurate). Scutlix can only target enemies in its field of vision, which is a roughly 120-degree cone in front of it. It cannot target enemies behind it unless the player manually turns it around to face them, which also occurs when the player attacks in that direction."
