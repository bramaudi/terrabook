    "The <b>Bloody Machete</b> is a rare and unique boomerang-type weapon that can drop only during the Halloween seasonal event. When thrown, as it falls downward after reaching a maximum range, and returns to the thrower upon impacting a block or enemy. Its physics are similar to the Magic Dagger, but it must return to the player before being thrown again. It inflicts melee damage, rather than magic or ranged damage.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
