    "The <b>Bone Helm</b> is an Expert Mode accessory obtained from the Treasure Bag dropped by the Deerclops. When equipped, it summons Shadow Hand projectiles to damage enemies. These Shadow Hands are spawned a distance from enemies before flying at them, piercing anything in their path including blocks. Their flight behavior mirrors the Shadow Hands found in the Deerclops fight, either flying straight or swerving harshly in flight."
