    "The <b>moon</b> in <i><linked>Terraria</linked></i> moves through a cycle of eight different <b>phases</b>, with the next phase in the cycle appearing each <linked>night</linked>. The current phase is indicated by the amount of the moon that is visible during the night. The phase of the moon affects many things, some being the shop inventory of certain <linked>NPCs</linked>, certain <linked>enemy</linked> <linked>spawn rates</linked>, and the player's <linked>Fishing Power</linked>.",
    "It takes eight in-game nights for the moon to move through all of its phases. The cycle begins with the full moon upon world creation, where the entire circular moon is visible, and four nights later, after three waning phases, reaches the new moon, where no moon is visible. Another four nights later, after three waxing phases, the cycle ends with the return of the full moon.",
    "Each moon phase starts at dawn (4:30 AM) and lasts until the next dawn. Therefore, a moon phase also encompasses the day preceding the night of that moon phase. This is important because most phase-dependent content and effects are not limited to nighttime.",
    "The current moon phase can be determined using the <linked>Sextant</linked>, an <linked>informational accessory</linked> which can be obtained from the <linked>Angler</linked> <linked>NPC</linked> as a <linked>fishing</linked> quest reward, or any of its upgrades.",
    "A <linked>Blood Moon</linked> can occur during any moon phase except for a new moon. A <linked>Pumpkin Moon</linked> or <linked>Frost Moon</linked> can be summoned by the player on any night."
