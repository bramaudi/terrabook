    "<b>Doctor Bones</b> is a zombie variant that rarely appears in the Jungle and Underground Jungle at night. It acts the same as normal zombies, slowly walking towards the player to deal contact damage, while attempting to navigate around obstacles and only being able to open doors during a Blood Moon. It has significantly greater health than all other zombies and deals slightly higher damage. It drops the Archaeologist's Hat when killed.",
