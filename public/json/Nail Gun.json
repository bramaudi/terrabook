    "The <b>Nail Gun</b> is a Hardmode, post-Plantera ranged weapon which has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>4*</s>1/25 (4%)</span> / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\"><span class=\"chance\"><s>7.84*</s>49/625 (7.84%)</span></abbr> chance to drop from Nailhead during Solar Eclipses. It uses Nails as ammunition, which are sold by both the Merchant and the Arms Dealer when the player has the Nail Gun in their inventory for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Silver Coin\" data-sort-value=\"100\"><span class=\"sc\">1</span></span> each.",
    "When a Nail hits an enemy, it sticks to it. It deals 15% damage (17 base damage) on impact, but explodes after 1.5 seconds, dealing 135% damage (155 base damage). The Nails also stick to surfaces and explode in the same manner. The explosion does not damage the shooter. Nails are unaffected by gravity until they have flown roughly 30 tiles, at which point they fly with an arc similar to that of an arrow. If used in PvP, the Nails will not stick to players and will instead deal normal damage (115 base damage).",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Demonic</b>, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. <span class=\"eico i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span> It can also get the <b>Deadly</b> modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr>."
