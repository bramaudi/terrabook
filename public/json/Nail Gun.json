    "The <b>Nail Gun</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>launcher</linked>-like <linked>weapon</linked> that consumes <linked>Nails</linked> as <linked>ammunition</linked>. When a Nail makes contact with an enemy, it deals 15% damage (17 base damage) and sticks to the damaged enemy before exploding after 1.5 seconds, dealing 135% damage (155 base damage). Nails will also stick to solid <linked>blocks</linked> and explode in the same manner, and their explosions do not damage the shooter. Nails are unaffected by gravity until they have flown roughly 30 tiles, at which point they fly with an arc similar to that of an arrow. If used in <linked>PvP</linked>, the Nails will not stick to players and will instead deal normal damage (115 base damage).",
    "The Nail Gun has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"4\">1/25 (4%)</span> / <linked>49/625 (7.84%)</linked> chance to drop from <linked>Nailheads</linked> during the <linked>Solar Eclipse</linked> <linked>event</linked>.
