Depending on the statue, upon activation it may spawn <linked>enemies</linked>, drop <linked>items</linked>, or teleport an <linked>NPC</linked> to the statue's location. Most statues can be found already <linked>placed</linked> in any area <linked>underground</linked> (most frequently in the <linked>Dungeon</linked>, <linked>Underground Cabins</linked>, and <linked>Cavern</linked> level), though Angel Statues also appear in <linked>chests</linked>.
