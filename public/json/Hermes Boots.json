    "<b>Hermes Boots</b> are an <linked>accessory</linked> that can be found in <linked>Chests</linked> in the <linked>Underground</linked> and <linked>Cavern</linked> layers. When equipped, they allow the <linked>player</linked> to gain a <linked>movement speed</linked> boost after running for a certain distance continuously. The speed will continue increasing until maximum speed is attained. At full sprint, they will increase the player's horizontal movement speed to <abbr title=\"30 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 22 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">30 mph</span></abbr>. However, if the player runs into a wall without autojumping, the player will stop and have to speed up again. <i>(See <linked>Sprinting accessories</linked> for more information on the sprint effect).</i>",
