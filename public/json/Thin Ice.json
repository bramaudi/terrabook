    "<b>Thin Ice</b> is a type of block found in the Snow and Ice biomes. It is found naturally in two configurations: either a single layer over a pool of water, or in large packed regions underground.",
    "Similar to Ice Blocks, Thin Ice has reduced friction, and players will slide across it. Thin Ice will break if a player falls on it at a certain speed, usually achieved by falling normally onto it. Landing on Thin Ice will not cause fall damage itself, but it will not slow the player's fall on contact, and fall damage will continue to accumulate until the player lands on another block type (unlike Cobwebs, for instance, which reset fall damage). Ice Skates or any of the combined accessories that use them as an ingredient can be used to land on Thin Ice without breaking it and dropping through (also potentially taking fall damage, however).",
    "Thin Ice is destroyed permanently when broken, dropping nothing. On the [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console version, Nintendo 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version] version, and [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader version, Thin Ice cannot be picked up, crafted, or moved in any way."
