    "The <b>Tortured Soul</b> is an uncommon Hardmode enemy found in The Underworld. If the player throws Purification Powder on him, he will transform into the Tax Collector NPC. Afterwards, the Tortured Soul will no longer spawn. If the Tax Collector is killed, he will respawn naturally without the need to purify another Tortured Soul. Only one Tortured Soul can be alive at a time.",
