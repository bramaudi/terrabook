    "The <b>Rod of Harmony</b> is a post-Moon Lord tool. It functions identically to the Rod of Discord, instantly teleporting the player to the location of cursor when used, but it does not inflict the Chaos State debuff, allowing the player to safely teleport much more frequently.",
    "It is obtained by throwing the Rod of Discord into Shimmer in a world where Moon Lord has been defeated."
