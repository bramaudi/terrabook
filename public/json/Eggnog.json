    "The <b>Eggnog</b> is a type of healing potion dropped from Presents obtained during the Christmas event, with a chance of 8.101% in pre-Hardmode and 7.561% in Hardmode. It heals 80 health points. Because it can be potentially found so early on, Eggnog can be used as a viable alternative to Lesser Healing Potions. These, along with a bunch of Star Anises, are great when fighting the Eye of Cthulhu."
