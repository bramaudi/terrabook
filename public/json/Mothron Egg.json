    "<b>Mothron</b> is a powerful post-<linked>Plantera</linked> flying <linked>enemy</linked> that spawns during the <linked>Solar Eclipse</linked> event. Mothrons can pass through all <linked>blocks</linked> and attack by chasing after the player or aligning themselves horizontally with them before lunging towards them at varying speeds, inflicting heavy contact damage depending on their velocity. Occasionally, it lands on blocks to lay several Mothron Eggs that will spawn Baby Mothrons if they are not destroyed in time, much like <span class=\"eil\"><span><linked>Lepus</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i5\" title=\"3DS version\"><b></b><i></i><span>(3DS version)</span></span></span>.",
    "It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <linked>Lifeform Analyzer</linked> or its upgrades. Mothron requires 25 kills to be awarded completion of their <linked>Bestiary</linked> entry and corresponding banner, as opposed to the usual 50 kills."
