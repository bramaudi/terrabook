    "The <b>Star Veil</b> is a Hardmode accessory that combines the functions of the Star Cloak and the Cross Necklace. The falling stars will pass through all blocks until reaching the player's altitude, at which point they continue falling until hitting solid blocks. It also doubles the duration of the invincibility a player is afforded after taking damage, from 2/3 of a second (0.67 s) to 4/3 seconds (1.33 s)."
