    "The <b>Snake Charmer's Flute</b> is an item that summons a climbable snake. When used, it places a pot that a snake rises from. Once the snake reaches its full height of 80 blocks or touches a block, it stops rising and becomes climbable like a Rope. It is also possible to place blocks against it when it is fully extended, and as such, it is possible to climb to the top of the Space layer by alternating between using the flute and blocks. The snake and the pot disappear after approximately 25 seconds. It also produces a small amount of light. It can be found in the Sandstone Chests in the Underground Desert biome, or from Oasis Crates and Mirage Crates."
