    "The <b>Snake Charmer's Flute</b> is a <linked>tool</linked> item that summons a climbable snake. It can be found in <linked>Sandstone Chests</linked> in the <linked>Underground Desert</linked> <linked>biome</linked>, or from <linked>Oasis Crates</linked> and <linked>Mirage Crates</linked>.",
    "When used, it places a pot that a snake rises from. Once the snake reaches its full height of 100 tiles or touches a block, it stops rising and becomes climbable like a <linked>Rope</linked>. It is also possible to place blocks against it when it is fully extended. The snake and the pot disappear after approximately 25 seconds. It also produces a small amount of light."
