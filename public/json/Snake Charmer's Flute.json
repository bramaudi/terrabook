    "The <b>Snake Charmer's Flute</b> is a tool item that summons a climbable snake. It can be found in Sandstone Chests in the Underground Desert biome, or from Oasis Crates and Mirage Crates.",
    "When used, it places a pot that a snake rises from. Once the snake reaches its full height of 100 tiles or touches a block, it stops rising and becomes climbable like a Rope. It is also possible to place blocks against it when it is fully extended. The snake and the pot disappear after approximately 25 seconds. It also produces a small amount of light."
