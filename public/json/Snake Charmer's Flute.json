    "The <b>Snake Charmer's Flute</b> is a <linked>pre-Hardmode</linked> <linked>tool</linked> that places a pot from which a snake rises. Once the snake reaches its full height of 100 tiles or touches a block, it stops rising and becomes climbable like a <linked>rope</linked>. It is also possible to place blocks against it when it is fully extended. The snake and the pot disappear after approximately 25 seconds. It also produces a small amount of light.
