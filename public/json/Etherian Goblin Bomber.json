    "The <b>Etherian Goblin Bomber</b> is an <linked>enemy</linked> that spawns during the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> <linked>event</linked>. As its name implies, it attacks by hurling Goblin Bomb projectiles at its target, similar to <linked>Clowns</linked>. While they might not pose the biggest threat to players with decent equipment, they can easily gain the upper hand against an early-game defender, especially if the <linked>Tavernkeep</linked> is discovered directly after defeating the <linked>Eater of Worlds</linked> or <linked>Brain of Cthulhu</linked>. Like many other enemies from the event, its appearance and stats change, depending on what point in the game the player has reached.",
    "The Etherian Goblin Bomber requires 500 kills to be awarded completion of its corresponding <linked>banner</linked>, as opposed to the usual 50 kills."
