    "<b>Coin Piles</b> are <linked>background objects</linked> created when the player <linked>places</linked> a Copper, Silver, Gold, or Platinum <linked>Coin</linked> on the ground. They are for decorative purposes only. Only one coin is needed to create a pile (which occupies 1 tile, <linked>[img:Coin Pile One Tile]</linked>), but additional coins can be added to increase the pile size. Coin Piles can, like other <linked>furniture</linked>, be destroyed with a <linked>pickaxe</linked> or a <linked>drill</linked>. This allows a player to pick up the coins again.",
    "Each Coin Pile shown below consists of six placed Coin items.",
    "Coin piles are capable of rarely generating underground, specifically in the <linked>campsite</linked> and <linked>mosaic</linked> mini-biomes."
