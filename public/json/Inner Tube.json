    "The <b>Inner Tube</b> is an accessory that causes the player to float on the surface of liquids instead of sinking to the bottom. The effect can be temporarily negated by holding <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"S (PC default)\">â–¼ Abajo</span></kbd></span>. It can be found in Water Chests, as well as Ocean Crates and Seaside Crates.",
    "The Inner Tube's effects are replaced with the Flipper's effect if the player is holding a Trident. Neptune's Shell and its derivative accessories will override the Inner Tube's effects entirely."
