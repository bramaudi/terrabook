{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Truffle Worm","summaries":["The <b>Truffle Worm</b> is a rare critter that spawns in the underground Glowing Mushroom biome during Hardmode. It is solely used to summon the Duke Fishron boss. In order to use it, it must be caught (e.g. with a Bug Net) and used as bait with a fishing pole in an Ocean biome. [img:Desktop version] [img:Console version] [img:Old-gen console version] It only spawns in the Cavern layer and below, so it will not appear in surface Glowing Mushroom biomes.","The Truffle Worm is more difficult to catch than other critters, as it burrows away when a player comes too close. It must be approached quickly in order to successfully catch it.","Unlike most critters, the Truffle Worm cannot be used for ordinary fishing, as it is used to spawn Duke Fishron. When attempting to use it as bait, the bobber will simply sit in the water indefinitely, unless fishing in an Ocean.","The Truffle Worm will always be consumed upon summoning Duke Fishron. Items that reduce the chance of bait consumption such as the Tackle Box will have no effect.","On the [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader version, Truffle Worms can be killed by enemies.","It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <span class=\"eil\"><span>Lifeform Analyzer</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> or its upgrades."],"statistics":{"Environment":"<div class=\"tags\"><span class=\"tag\"> Glowing Mushroom biome </span></div>","AI Type":"Passive Worm AI","Damage":"<span class=\"npcstat\"><span class=\"m-all\">0</span></span>","Max Life":"<span class=\"npcstat\"><span class=\"m-all\">5</span></span>","Defense":"<span class=\"npcstat\"><span class=\"m-all\">0</span></span>","KB Resist":"<span class=\"npcstat\"><span class=\"m-all\">0%</span></span>"},"crafts":{"Used in":[{"result":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i multi-line\">[img:Truffle Worm Cage]<span><span>Truffle Worm Cage</span></span></span>"},"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Terrarium]<span><span>Terrarium</span></span></span></li><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Truffle Worm]<span><span>Truffle Worm</span></span></span></li></ul>"},"station":{"rowspan":1,"value":"By Hand"}}]}}
