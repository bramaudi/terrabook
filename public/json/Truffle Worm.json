    "The <b>Truffle Worm</b> is a rare <linked>critter</linked> that spawns in the underground <linked>Glowing Mushroom biome</linked> during <linked>Hardmode</linked>. It is solely used as <linked>bait</linked> to summon the <linked>Duke Fishron</linked> <linked>boss</linked>. It only spawns in the <linked>Underground</linked> layer and below, so it will not appear in <linked>surface</linked> Glowing Mushroom biomes.",

    "The Truffle Worm can be caught with any <linked>Bug Net</linked>, however it is more difficult to catch than other critters, as it burrows away when a player comes too close. It must be approached quickly in order to successfully catch it. After being caught, it can be carried around in the <linked>inventory</linked> and released later, or crafted into animated decorative <linked>furniture</linked> (<linked>Truffle Worm Cage</linked>). Once crafted, the Truffle Worm cannot be released again.",
    "Despite having a bait power of 666%, the Truffle Worm cannot be used for ordinary <linked>fishing</linked>, and can only be used to summon Duke Fishron by fishing in the <linked>Ocean</linked> biome. When attempting to use it as bait elsewhere, the bobber will simply sit in the water indefinitely.",
    "The Truffle Worm will always be consumed upon summoning Duke Fishron. Items that reduce the chance of bait consumption such as the <linked>Tackle Box</linked> or its upgrades will have no effect.",
    "It is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <span class=\"eil\"><span><linked>Lifeform Analyzer</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span></span> or its upgrades."
