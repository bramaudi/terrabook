    "The <b>Weather Pain</b> is a pre-Hardmode magic weapon which casts a Hurtnado upon use, a small tornado projectile that vanishes after a short time. The Hurtnado homes in on nearby enemies and stays latched onto them for a few seconds, dealing consistent damage. It bounces off blocks, pierces enemies up to 15 times and has 10 armor penetration. The Weather Pain is dropped by the Deerclops with a <span class=\"chance\"><s>25*</s>1/4 (25%)</span> chance.",
