    "The <b>Kobold</b> is an enemy only found in tiers 2 and 3 of the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> <linked>event</linked>, spawning from the <linked>Mysterious Portal</linked>. When it gets near the player or Eternia Crystal, it will show a speech bubble with an exclamation mark, light its fuse, and begin dashing towards the nearest target. When it reaches a target or its fuse time runs out, it will detonate, damaging any target caught in the explosion. The detonation will not destroy tiles, similarly to the <linked>Grenade</linked>.",
    "Like other members of the Old One's Army, if a Kobold's target is too far away or obstructed, it will enter an ethereal state, allowing it to float upwards and pass through tiles. Kobolds are also unaffected by <linked>Teleporters</linked> or <linked>Lava</linked>, and will take half damage from <linked>Traps</linked>.",
    "The Kobold requires 200 kills to be awarded with its corresponding banner, as opposed to the usual 50 kills."
