    "<b>Glowing Mushroom Dye</b> is a <linked>dye</linked> acquired by giving a <linked>Strange Plant</linked> to the <linked>Dye Trader</linked>. It colors the object it is used on a deep blue color. Like the name implies, objects colored with this dye will also glow slightly in the dark. Though it does not give off any light to see nearby objects with, this can be useful to increase awareness of where the player is."
