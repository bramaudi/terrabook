    "The <b>KO Cannon</b> is a Hardmode melee weapon which has a <span class=\"etxt\"><span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span><span><span class=\"chance\"><s>20*</s>1/5 (20%)</span> chance to be dropped by Clown</span></span> / <span class=\"etxt\"><span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span><span><span class=\"chance\"><s>0.1*</s>1/1000 (0.1%)</span> chance to be dropped by any enemy during a Hardmode Blood Moon</span></span>. It autofires a boxing glove projectile that is connected to the weapon's base by a short, thick chain. After striking a target or traveling 17 blocks, the glove retracts back into the weapon before being ready to fire again.",
    "Despite this weapon having a relatively short range, its higher knockback, base damage, and immunity to gravitational arcing makes it very strong at close quarters.",
    "The KO Cannon has no cooldown period; therefore its autofire rate is dependent only on the distance to its impact, meaning that an enemy or object in close range will cause a faster autofire rate.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
