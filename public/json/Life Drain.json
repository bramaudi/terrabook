    "The <b>Life Drain</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>magic weapon</linked> that deals constant damage to all enemies near the cursor's position, as long as the distance between the player and the cursor is unobstructed. A stream of red particles flows toward the user from each targeted enemy. While the weapon is in use, the user receives the <b>Life Drain</b> <linked>buff</linked>, which adds 1.5 health per second to existing <linked>health regeneration</linked>, plus 0.5 health per second for every two extra enemies hit, while also increasing the ramp-up speed of natural regeneration greatly. While an enemy is being damaged by the Life Drain, it is also inflicted with a special <linked>debuff</linked> that deals 5 damage per tick. The Life Drain has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"20\">1/5 (20%)</span> chance to be dropped by <linked>Crimson Mimics</linked>.",
