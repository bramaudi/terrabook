    "<b>Dart Traps</b> are traps that fire poisoned darts when triggered via wire. The trap does not consume any ammunition, its output being limited only by how frequently it can be triggered, which is a maximum of once every 3 1/3 seconds (<span class=\"eico i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 3 seconds). Dart Traps are found naturally placed in random areas in the Cavern layer, and more frequently in the Dungeon, and can be freed and harvested by players with a pickaxe or drill. They are found wired to Pressure Plates that trigger when the player or an enemy steps on them.",
    "In order to use harvested Dart Traps, players must wire them to a triggering mechanism that sends a signal to the trap, which can be done with tools available from the Mechanic (who can be found in the Dungeon after Skeletron is defeated). Dart Traps will be placed facing the direction the player is facing, and on the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, and [img:Legacy tModLoader version] Legacy tModLoader version, can be hammered to rotate them after being placed, allowing them to fire vertically."
