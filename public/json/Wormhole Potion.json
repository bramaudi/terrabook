    "The <b>Wormhole Potion</b> is a potion which allows a player to instantly teleport to another team member's location in multiplayer, by selecting their player icon in the full-screen map (accessible by pressing the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"M (PC default): Cycles map display\">Toggle Full Map</span></kbd></span> key). It is only possible to teleport to players of the same team, and the teleport will be announced in a status message. It is not possible to use Wormhole Potions if the player has the minimap disabled.",
    "Wormhole Potions can drop from Pots and slimes, but only in multiplayer. Note that other players do not have to be online for the potion to drop, so just selecting multiplayer and hosting the game can allow collecting the potions. Wormhole Potions can be crafted in a singleplayer world as well.",
    "It has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from Slimes."
