    "The <b>War Axe of the Night</b> is an axe crafted from Demonite Bars. It is stronger than the Gold and Platinum Axes, but weaker than the Meteor Hamaxe. It has a Crimtane counterpart, the Blood Lust Cluster, which is stronger but also slightly slower. Like all axes, it is used to cut down Trees, Cacti and Giant Glowing Mushrooms.",
    "Despite having a higher base damage and autoswing, its slow speed means that the maximum damage output is similar to manual-swing swords such as the Gold and Platinum Broadsword, and especially less than the Light's Bane.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Light</b> for harvesting purposes and <b>Legendary</b> for combat purposes."
