    "<b>Fallen Logs</b> are naturally-generated <linked>background objects</linked> that appear on the <linked>Surface</linked> in <linked>Forest</linked> <linked>biomes</linked>. At <linked>night</linked>, <linked>fairies</linked> will occasionally spawn at a Fallen Log. Fairies can also spawn underground, but only as long as there is at least one Fallen Log is present at the surface layer in the world (see exact area <linked>below</linked>). Thus, destroying all Fallen Logs in a world will permanently stop Fairies from spawning naturally, and <linked>shaking</linked> <linked>Hallowed trees</linked> will be the only way to obtain them.",
    "Unlike most background items, Fallen Logs can only be destroyed with an <linked>axe</linked>. They will be destroyed when the <linked>grass</linked> beneath them is <linked>converted</linked> to <linked>Corrupt grass</linked> or <linked>Crimson grass</linked>, but <linked>Hallowed grass</linked> conversion does not destroy them. They drop 10–20 <linked>Wood</linked> upon destruction. The blocks beneath them cannot be mined until the log is destroyed, similarly to <linked>trees</linked>."
