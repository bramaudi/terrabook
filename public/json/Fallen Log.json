{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Fallen Log","summaries":["<b>Fallen Logs</b> are naturally-generated background objects that appear on the Surface in Forest biomes. At night, fairies will occasionally spawn at a Fallen Log. Fairies can also spawn underground, but only as long as there is at least one Fallen Log is present at the surface layer in the world (see exact area below). Thus, destroying all Fallen Logs in a world will permanently stop Fairies from spawning naturally, and shaking Hallowed trees will be the only way to obtain them.","Unlike most background items, Fallen Logs can only be destroyed with an axe. They will be destroyed when the grass beneath them is converted to Corrupt grass or Crimson grass, but Hallowed grass conversion does not destroy them. They drop 10–20 Wood upon destruction. The blocks beneath them cannot be mined until the log is destroyed, similarly to trees."],"statistics":{"Placeable":"<span class=\"t-yes\">✔️</span> <span class=\"small-bold\">(3 wide × 2 high)</span>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 0]</span>"},"crafts":{}}
