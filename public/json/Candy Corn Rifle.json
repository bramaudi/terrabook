    "Candy Corn shots pierce up to two enemies and ricochet up to four times, dissipating on their fifth impact or upon hitting a third enemy. The gun has a high fire rate, but unlike most guns, its projectiles are affected by gravity and do not remain airborne for long, though their ricocheting ability helps them gain distance. The Candy Corn Rifle has a base 10% <linked>critical strike chance</linked> as opposed to the usual 4%. Furthermore, it has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>33.33*</s>1/3 (33.33%)</span> chance to <linked>not consume ammo</linked>.
