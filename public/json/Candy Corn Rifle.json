    "The <b>Candy Corn Rifle</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>gun</linked> that fires <b>Candy Corn</b> as <linked>ammunition</linked>. Candy Corn shots pierce up to two <linked>enemies</linked> and ricochet up to four times, dissipating on their fifth impact or upon hitting a third enemy. The gun has a high fire rate, but unlike most guns, its projectiles are affected by gravity and do not remain airborne for long, though their ricocheting ability helps them gain distance. The Candy Corn Rifle also has a base 10% <linked>critical strike chance</linked> as opposed to the usual 4%, and has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"33.33\">1/3 (33.33%)</span> chance <linked>not to consume ammo</linked>.",
    "The Candy Corn Rifle is dropped by the <linked>Pumpking</linked> during the <linked>Pumpkin Moon</linked> <linked>event</linked> with a 1.56–12.5% (<linked>6.25–12.5%</linked>) chance depending on the current wave. When dropped, the Candy Corn Rifle is always accompanied by 50 to 100 Candy Corn.
