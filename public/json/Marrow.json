    "The <b>Marrow</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>bow</linked> that converts any type of <linked>arrow</linked> into special Bone Arrows, which is not to be confused with the visually similar <linked>Bone Arrow</linked> item. These Bone Arrows fire at higher velocities than average arrows and suffer minimal drop along their course, giving the Marrow a much straighter shot than most bows. However, while the used arrow's base damage is accounted for, the special properties of converted arrows are entirely lost. The Marrow has a base 9% <linked>critical strike chance</linked>, as opposed to the usual 4%.
