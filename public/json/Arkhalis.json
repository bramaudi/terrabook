    "The <b>Arkhalis</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>melee weapon</linked> that is part of <linked>Arkhalis' set</linked> and is only obtainable through Hardmode <linked>Treasure Bags</linked> in <linked>Expert Mode</linked> (except <linked>Queen Slime</linked>'s). It appears to be a <linked>sword</linked>, but does not present an actual blade when used. Instead of an overhead <linked>broadsword</linked> swing or a <linked>shortsword</linked> stab, the Arkhalis <linked>autoswings</linked> and appears as a series of blurred slashes aimed in the direction of the cursor. Anything within this area takes constant damage at a rate far exceeding the weapon's stated use time. This damaging area has a rather wide spread, even attacking behind the player for a very short distance. In addition, the Arkhalis has 20 <linked>armor penetration</linked>.",
    "The <linked>Terragrim</linked> is the Arkhalis's weaker, <linked>pre-Hardmode</linked> variant that is obtainable from <linked>Enchanted Sword Shrines</linked>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount. The Arkhalis's unique means of attack is unaffected by any size and speed modifiers."
