{"type":"weapons","title":"Cool Whip","summaries":["The <b>Cool Whip</b> is a Hardmode whip. Like other whips, it causes minions to focus on the last-struck enemy.","Upon striking an enemy, it will create a temporary snowflake projectile that chases nearby enemies, dealing 15 damage to them on contact. The summoned snowflake has 30 armor penetration and is not affected by damage bonuses outside of banners. If a snowflake is already summoned, attacking with the whip will reset its timer instead of creating a new one. It also inflicts the Frostbite debuff for 4 seconds.","If the Cool Whip hits multiple targets in a single attack, the damage dealt by each consecutive hit will be reduced by 30%.","Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>."],"statistics":{"Damage":"45 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Summon)</span>","Knockback":"1.5 <span class=\"knockback\">(Extremely weak)</span>","Use time":"30 <span class=\"usetime\">(Average)</span>","Velocity":"8<small> (effective)</small>","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">6 summon tag damage<br>Your summons will focus struck enemies<br>Strike enemies to summon a friendly snowflake<br>'Let me have some of that cool whip'</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 4]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"4 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"40000\"><span class=\"gc\">4</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{"Recipes":[{"result":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i multi-line\">[img:Cool Whip]<span><span>Cool Whip</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span>"},"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Soul of Light]<span><span>Soul of Light</span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(8)</span></li><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Soul of Night]<span><span>Soul of Night</span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(8)</span></li><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Frost Core]<span><span>Frost Core</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i3 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Old-gen console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span></li></ul>"},"station":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i\">[img:Mythril Anvil]<span><span>Mythril Anvil</span></span></span><br><i><b>or</b></i><br><span class=\"i\">[img:Orichalcum Anvil]<span><span>Orichalcum Anvil</span></span></span>"}}]}}
