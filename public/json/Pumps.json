    "<b>Inlet</b> and <b>Outlet Pumps</b> are <linked>mechanisms</linked> used to transport <linked>liquids</linked> (<linked>water</linked>, <linked>lava</linked>, <linked>honey</linked>, and <linked>shimmer</linked>), without having to construct pathways through <linked>blocks</linked> or rely on gravity. Instead, an Inlet and Outlet Pump need only be connected to each other with <linked>Wires</linked> and activated, which transfers fluid from the Inlet to the Outlet. Each activation transfers up to four tiles of liquid. For continuous automated pumping, a <linked>timer</linked> can be used.",
    "Despite its appearance as a pipe that takes in liquid from beside it, an Inlet Pump must be submerged in liquid, as it removes liquid that lies directly over its graphic, and does so equally from all of its 2×2 tile space. Similarly, an Outlet Pump spawns liquid directly over its graphic, and does so equally over all of its 2×2 tile space."
