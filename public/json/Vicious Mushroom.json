{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Vicious Mushroom","summaries":["A <b>Vicious Mushroom</b> is a species of mushroom found on tainted grass in The Crimson, where they can be cut and collected with a single swing of any Weapon or Tool. They cannot be eaten or brewed into any potions, and are used solely to craft Vicious Powder.","Like other mushrooms, they can not be grown in a Clay Pot even with Crimson Grasses. Growing Vile Mushrooms will be converted into ordinary Mushrooms if they are purified using Purification Powder or the Clentaminator. Vicious Mushrooms can also be obtained by using Vicious Powder on Vile Mushrooms, and vice-versa."],"statistics":{"Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 0]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"10 Copper Coins\" data-sort-value=\"10\"><span class=\"cc\">10</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">25 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{"Used in":[{"result":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i multi-line\">[img:Vicious Powder]<span><span>Vicious Powder</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(5)</span>"},"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Vicious Mushroom]<span><span>Vicious Mushroom</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span></li></ul>"},"station":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i\">[img:Placed Bottle]<span><span>Placed Bottle</span></span></span><br><i><b>or</b></i><br><span class=\"i -w\">[img:Alchemy Table]<span><span>Alchemy Table</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span>"}}]}}
