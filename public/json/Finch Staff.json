    "The <b>Finch Staff</b> is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon that summons a <b>Baby Finch</b> minion. It attacks by flying towards enemies and dealing contact damage. Like other minions, the summoned Baby Finch is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. The Finch Staff is a starting item for Journey Mode characters, and can be found in Living Wood Chests within Living Trees in all modes.",
    "While the Baby Finch buff is active, a nest appears on the player's head, in which the Baby Finch will rest when not attacking. When multiple Baby Finches are summoned, they will all be visible on the player's head.",
    "Unlike most other summon weapons, its best possible modifier is <b>Mythical</b> because both the Ruthless and Mythical modifiers only raise its base damage to 8 due to rounding."
