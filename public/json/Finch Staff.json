{"type":"weapons","title":"Finch Staff","summaries":["The <b>Finch Staff</b> is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon that summons a <b>Baby Finch</b> minion. It attacks by flying towards enemies and dealing contact damage. Like other minions, the summoned Baby Finch is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. The Finch Staff is a starting item for Journey Mode characters, and can be found in Living Wood Chests within Living Trees in all modes.","While the Baby Finch buff is active, a nest appears on the player's head, in which the Baby Finch will rest when not attacking. When multiple Baby Finches are summoned, they will all be visible on the player's head.","Unlike most other summon weapons, its best possible modifier is <b>Mythical</b> because both the Ruthless and Mythical modifiers only raise its base damage to 8 due to rounding."],"statistics":{"Damage":"7 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Summon)</span>","Knockback":"4 <span class=\"knockback\">(Weak)</span>","Mana":"10","Use time":"36 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very slow)</span>","Velocity":"10","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Summons a baby finch to fight for you</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 1]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Gold Coin\" data-sort-value=\"10000\"><span class=\"gc\">1</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{"Recipes":[{"result":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i multi-line\">[img:Finch Staff]<span><span>Finch Staff</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span>"},"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Living Wood Wand]<span><span>Living Wood Wand</span></span></span></li></ul>"},"station":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i -w\">[img:Shimmer]<span><span>Shimmer Transmutation</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span>"}}]}}
