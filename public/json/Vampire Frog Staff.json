    "The <b>Vampire Frog Staff</b> is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon. It spawns a Vampire Frog minion that follows the player and attacks enemies using its tongue. Like other minions, the summoned Vampire Frog is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world. It has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>12.5*</s>1/8 (12.5%)</span> chance to be dropped by a Zombie Merman or Wandering Eye Fish, both of which will spawn while fishing during a Blood Moon.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>, <b>Mythical</b>, <b>Masterful</b>, <b>Godly</b>, <b>Demonic</b>, or <b>Furious</b>, which all raise its base damage by the same amount due to rounding."
