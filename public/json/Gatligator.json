    "The <b>Gatligator</b> is a Hardmode gun that fires as fast as the Megashark, and shares the 50% chance not to consume ammo. This weapon is very inaccurate, spreading bullets in random directions over a spread of about 30 degrees, making it very difficult to hit enemies from a far distance. It also fires at varying velocity. It is purchased from the Traveling Merchant for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"35 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"350000\"><span class=\"gc\">35</span></span>, while in Hardmode.",
    "The Chain Gun operates similarly, and can be considered an upgrade.",
