    "<b>Diseaster Bunnies</b> come from the small eggs laid by <linked>Lepus</linked>, and therefore look like a miniature version of it. They also appear instead of <linked>Bunnies</linked> during <linked>Easter</linked>, at any time of the day, and so long as the world has been in play for a couple of in-game days. It acts exactly like a <linked>Corrupt Bunny</linked>. They can be quite annoying for new players, due to their high attack, health, speed and jumping ability, and the fact that they can spawn anywhere on the surface at any time."
