    "The <b>Tempest Staff</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>summon weapon</linked> which spawns a small <b>Sharknado</b> <linked>minion</linked> that attacks by intermittently firing Mini Sharkron projectiles, which splatter upon contact with <linked>enemies</linked> or surfaces akin to a miniature version of <linked>Duke Fishron</linked>'s own Sharknado attack. The Sharknado minion also deals contact damage to enemies and fires Mini Sharkrons at surrounding targets while returning to the player. Like other <linked>minions</linked>, the summoned Sharknado is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the <linked>buff</linked>, or leaves the world. The Tempest Staff has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"20\">1/5 (20%)</span> chance of being dropped by <linked>Duke Fishron</linked>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal <linked>critical hits</linked>. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Tempest Staff has over a Ruthless one is <linked>knockback</linked>."
