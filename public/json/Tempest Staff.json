    "The <b>Tempest Staff</b> is a Hardmode summon weapon. It spawns a small <b>Sharknado</b> minion that follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, and attacks enemies automatically by firing Mini Sharkron projectiles which splatter against enemies and blocks. Its attack is akin to a miniature version of Duke Fishron's tornado/shark attack. The Tempest Staff has a 20% chance of being dropped by Duke Fishron.",
    "The Tempest Staff's tornado moves to intercept enemies at significant range, and can pass through blocks. The tornado itself also damages enemies on contact.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Tempest Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback."
