    "The <b>Stardust Dragon Staff</b> is a Hardmode, post-Lunatic Cultist summon weapon that summons a Stardust Dragon that attacks enemies. The Stardust Dragon constantly flies around the screen surrounding the player, and flies through blocks, attacking enemies by flying through them. It leaves a trail of sparkles that provide periodic bursts of light as it moves.",
    "The Stardust Dragon Staff is special in that if summoned more than once, multiple Dragons do not spawn â€” instead, the first spawned Dragon becomes longer by one segment for each additional summoning, broadening its area of attack and increasing its damage output. Each summon creates additional segments between the tail and the pre-tail segment, and re-summons the tail.",
    "The Stardust Dragon hits ten times per second. It inflicts damage according to the formula: <code><i>summon dmg</i>*(1.69 + .46[<i>summon length</i> - 1])</code>, which is then all multiplied by a random multiplier between 0.85 and 1.15. Each segment of the dragon deals damage based on the damage modifier on the staff used to summon them, which means that different segments of the dragon can deal different damage.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Stardust Dragon Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback."
