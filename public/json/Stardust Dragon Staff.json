    "The <b>Stardust Dragon Staff</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Lunatic Cultist</linked> <linked>summon weapon</linked> that summons a Stardust Dragon that attacks <linked>enemies</linked>. The Stardust Dragon constantly flies around the screen surrounding the player, and flies through <linked>blocks</linked>, attacking enemies by flying through them. It leaves a trail of sparkles that provide periodic bursts of light as it moves.",
    "The Stardust Dragon Staff is special in that if summoned more than once, multiple Dragons do not spawn — instead, the first spawned Dragon becomes longer and stronger for each additional summoning, broadening its area of attack and increasing its damage output. The initial summon will spawn a Stardust Dragon with four segments, and each additional summon adds two segments. The damage of the Dragon is calculated by the following formula:",
    "<code>Damage = Base damage × [ 1 + 0.23 × (total segments -1)]</code>",
    "So, the initial damage of a Stardust Dragon would be 67, and each additional summon will increase the damage by 46% of base damage (18 / 19 damage).",
    "The Stardust Dragon hits ten times per second.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal <linked>critical hits</linked>. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Stardust Dragon Staff has over a Ruthless one is <linked>knockback</linked>."
