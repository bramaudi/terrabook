    "The <b>Gold Broadsword</b> is the highest tier of early game metal broadswords, being stronger than the Silver Broadsword, yet is slightly weaker than its alternate version, the Platinum Broadsword. Like all broadswords, this sword has an arc motion, which is more useful for killing flying and jumping monsters than shortswords. While it doesn't do much damage, its faster speed means that it is equally if not more powerful than the War Axe of the Night.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>."
