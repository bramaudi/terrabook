    "The <b>Clentaminator</b> is a Hardmode tool which can be used to create or destroy biomes. It uses Solutions as ammunition, with each Solution spreading a different biome. It has a similar firing pattern to the Flamethrower, but has a much longer range, fires through blocks and works in water. The Clentaminator is generally the fastest means of spreading or removing Hallow, Corruption and Crimson. It can also rapidly convert Jungle to Glowing Mushroom biome and vice versa.",
    "It can be purchased from the Steampunker for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"2 Platinum Coins\" data-sort-value=\"2000000\"><span class=\"pc\">2</span></span>.",
    "On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, after the Moon Lord is defeated, the Clentaminator can be upgraded into the Terraformer by throwning it into Shimmer. Also, the Clentaminator will not be sold in don't dig up and get fixed boi worlds.",
    "The Clentaminator cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers."
