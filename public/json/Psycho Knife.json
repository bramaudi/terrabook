When holding the Psycho Knife and standing still, the player will quickly enter stealth mode, causing them to turn almost completely transparent, move much more slowly, and no longer be targeted by enemies.","Stealth mode is engaged gradually over the course of about one second, during which the weapon's stats are steadily boosted up to the following values:","<ul><li>Damage +300%: 340 (from 85) <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / 280 (from 70) <span class=\"eico i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span></li><li>Critical chance +30: 34% (from 4%)</li><li>Knockback +100%: 7 \"Strong\" (from 3.5 \"Weak\")</li></ul>","Stealth mode is disengaged when successfully attacking an enemy, when switching to a different weapon or when riding a mount. Swinging the weapon alone does not cancel stealth, nor does walking or flying. Standing still again afterward re-engages it. Moving or swinging the weapon during the one-second transition period, however, will cancel stealth mode.","Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>. Due to rounding, the Light modifier gives the same speed bonus as Legendary, with fewer other bonuses."],"statistics":{"Damage":"85 <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / 70 <span class=\"eico s i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span> <span class=\"small-bold\">(Melee)</span>","Knockback":"3.5 <span class=\"knockback\">(Weak)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"8 <span class=\"usetime\">(Insanely fast)</span> <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> /<br> 20 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span> <span class=\"eico s i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span>","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Allows you to go into stealth mode</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 8]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"10 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"100000\"><span class=\"gc\">10</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
