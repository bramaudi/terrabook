    "The <b>Super Dart Trap</b> is a post-Plantera trap found inside the Jungle Temple and, rarely, outside the Temple's door. Like its lesser counterpart, the Dart Trap, it fires a dart when activated via wire, which costs no ammunition, but a cooldown period of <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 3.33 seconds / <span class=\"eico i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> 3 seconds is required between firings. The dart is not affected by gravity and poisons the target, the poison lasting for 15 seconds and dealing 1 damage every half-second. The dart does less damage to the player at close range and roughly 80 damage to an unarmored player at further range, or about 40 damage to enemies.",
