    "The <b>Toxikarp</b> is a Hardmode ranged weapon that is obtained from fishing in The Corruption at any depth. It emits greenish bubbles that travel in the direction aimed for a short distance before ascending rapidly and inflict the Poisoned debuff. If the bubbles do not strike a creature or a block, they will eventually ascend into space. The bubbles can pass through platforms without breaking. If they come into contact with water, they will instantly start to ascend instead. The Toxikarp has infinite ammunition and will continue to launch bubbles as long as the player is firing it.",
    "It is the Corruption counterpart to the Crimson's Bladetongue and the Hallow's Crystal Serpent.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Unreal</b>."
