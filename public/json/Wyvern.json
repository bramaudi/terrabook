    "<b>Wyverns</b> are large Hardmode enemies that spawn in Space. They resemble Chinese dragons, are long and white, and follow the Worm AI. <b>Arch Wyverns</b> are the bronze-colored [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console and 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version]-exclusive variants.",
    "They will follow descending players down to ground level, and can fly through blocks, but regular Wyverns tend not to fly below ground.",
    "Wyverns will only spawn when the player is above a certain altitude (see Space § Notes). Outside of the Crimson, Corruption, and Dungeon biomes, and except during events, having at least one NPC near the player will also prevent them from spawning. A Wyvern will not spawn if another one is already alive, and like most enemies able to pass through blocks, it will not be able to spawn if the player themselves stays in front of player-placed walls, even if there are valid spawn points for the Wyvern."
