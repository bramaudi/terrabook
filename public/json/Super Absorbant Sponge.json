    "The <b>Super Absorbant Sponge</b> is an item that can be used to \"absorb\" water from the environment, causing water to disappear without storing it. It is awarded randomly by the Angler for completing fishing quests (1/70 chance after tenth quest in Hardmode).",
    "A single Super Absorbant Sponge can be used limitlessly and is never depleted. It works only on water, and has no effect on other liquids.",
    "The Super Absorbant Sponge can also drain water at a slightly faster speed than a standard empty bucket (especially when moving the cursor around while draining)."
