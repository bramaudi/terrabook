    "The <b>Old Man</b> is an NPC whose primary function is to summon Skeletron. He can be found at the Dungeon's entrance. When spoken to at night, the Old Man will give the player the option to \"<span class=\"gameText\">Curse</span>\", which summons Skeletron. When spoken to during the day, the Old Man will tell the player to return at night. He will also judge players with 300 maximum health (15 hearts) or less, or 10 defense or less as unworthy but still allows them to summon Skeletron.",
    "The Dungeon can be entered without defeating Skeletron, but traveling deeper than ground level within it (below zero depth) will spawn Dungeon Guardians that will most likely kill the player on contact (<i>see Guide:Dungeon Guardian strategies</i>).",
    "When Skeletron is defeated, the Old Man is freed from his curse and will arrive as the Clothier (as long as a vacant house is available), in addition to allowing access to the Dungeon."
