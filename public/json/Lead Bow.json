    "The <b>Lead Bow</b> is a low tier bow crafted using Lead Bars. It is stronger than the lowest tier of ore bows, the Copper Bow and Tin Bow, and is even slightly stronger than its counterpart, the Iron Bow. Like the other bows, its sole purpose is to fire arrows from a distance to damage enemies.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Demonic</b>, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> It can also get the <b>Deadly</b> modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr>."
