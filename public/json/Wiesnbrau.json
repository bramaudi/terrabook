    "The <b>Wiesnbräu</b> is a consumable buff potion that grants the <b>Drunk</b> buff when consumed. Under the effects of the buff, the damage the player takes and deals is halved (rounded up). This lasts for 30 seconds, but can be canceled at any time  by canceling the buff from the buffs screen. Consuming a Wiesnbräu also activates the Potion Sickness debuff, and it cannot be used while the debuff is active. It is purchased from the Merchant for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"9 Silver 95 Copper Coins\" data-sort-value=\"995\"><span class=\"sc\">9</span><span class=\"cc\">95</span></span>, during Oktoberfest."
