    "A <b>Tombstone</b> drops when a player <linked>dies</linked>. It can then be retrieved and used much like a <linked>sign</linked> or as a form of <linked>decoration</linked>. By default, they contain the <linked>death message</linked> generated based on how the player died. On the <linked>[img:Desktop version]</linked><linked> Desktop version</linked>, <linked>[img:Console version]</linked><linked> Console version</linked>, and <linked>[img:Mobile version]</linked><linked> Mobile version</linked>, Tombstones created will show the real life date the player died.",
    "Upon death, a Tombstone will bounce around until it lands on a 2×2 empty space, at which point it will place itself. Two Tombstones cannot land on each other, nor can they be retrieved if they fail to place themselves (e.g., due to lack of suitable space). If a Tombstone can not find a place to land, it will eventually despawn.",
    "Variants are chosen randomly upon death. Golden Tombstones drop when the player had more than <span class=\"coin\" title=\"10 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"100000\"><span class=\"gc\">10<i> GC</i></span></span> in their <linked>inventory</linked>.",
    "On the <linked>[img:Desktop version]</linked><linked> Desktop version</linked>, <linked>[img:Console version]</linked><linked> Console version</linked>, and <linked>[img:Mobile version]</linked><linked> Mobile version</linked>, having 4–8 Tombstones placed in close proximity will gradually darken and desaturate the environment. <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span> Five or more Tombstones placed in close proximity will generate a <linked>Graveyard</linked> <linked>mini-biome</linked>. Breaking a Tombstone may spawn a <linked>Ghost</linked> offscreen.",
    "The <span class=\"i\">[img:Strange Looking Tombstone]<span><span title=\"Strange Looking Tombstone\">Strange Looking Tombstone</span></span></span> is a <linked>3DS</linked><linked>[img:Nintendo 3DS version]</linked>-exclusive Tombstone variant dropped when the <linked>Worm Pet</linked> is active at death. Its tooltip is \"A Tombstone that kinda looks like a worm, right?\". It can be re-placed after being mined.",
    "In <linked>Hardcore</linked>, Tombstones cannot be easily obtained because death is permanent. On the <linked>[img:Desktop version]</linked><linked> Desktop version</linked>, <linked>[img:Console version]</linked><linked> Console version</linked>, and <linked>[img:Mobile version]</linked><linked> Mobile version</linked>, <linked>NPCs</linked> in worlds with Hardcore characters will now drop Tombstones when they are killed. This makes it possible to build <linked>Graveyards</linked> without the need for a non-Hardcore character. Variants are still chosen randomly, all NPCs drop a normal Tombstone except <linked>Merchant</linked> and <linked>Tax Collector</linked> who drop a golden variant.",
    "<span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span> Because Tombstones create Graveyards, and mark a place where a player had died, they are highlighted by <linked>Dangersense Potions</linked>.",
