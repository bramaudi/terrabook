    "The <b>Spike Ball</b> is an indestructible <linked>enemy</linked> found in the <linked>Dungeon</linked> which resembles a mace that swings around in a circle from a central pivot point (which cannot be destroyed either), and deals damage to the player on contact. Separate Spike Balls can have differing chain lengths. They spawn and despawn off-screen like any other enemy â€“ if the player leaves a room and returns later, it will have a different configuration of Spike Balls. They are much more likely to appear in Dungeon areas where there are <linked>Slab Walls</linked>."
