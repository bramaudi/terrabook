    "The <b>Mana Regeneration Band</b> is an accessory item made by combining a Band of Starpower and a Band of Regeneration at a Tinkerer's Workshop. It somewhat combines the effects of both bands, increasing a player's maximum mana and converting the bonus health regeneration provided by the Band of Regeneration into mana regeneration.",
    "The Band of Starpower, which is required for crafting the Mana Regeneration Band, is generally exclusive to worlds with Corruption, as it is obtained from Shadow Orbs and <span class=\"eil\"><span>Corrupt Crates</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>. Therefore, obtaining a Mana Regeneration Band in worlds with Crimson requires creating an artificial Corruption biome, e.g. by purchasing Corrupt Seeds from the Dryad in a Hardmode <span class=\"eil\"><span>Graveyard</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>. On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, the Band of Starpower can also be crafted from a Panic Necklace, however.",
    "On the Nintendo 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version] version, the Band of Starpower can additionally often be found in Living Wood Chests in Living Trees in any world."
