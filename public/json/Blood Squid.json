    "The <b>Blood Squid</b> is a flying Blood Moon enemy summoned by the Dreadnautilus. It resembles a regular Squid, but is red-colored, inflated and has multiple eyes on its body, similarly to the Drippler.",
    "It attempts to close in on the player and fire red projectiles at the player, similar to the Dreadnautilus's attacks, but with a higher damage. Like the Dreadnautilus, it recoils after each shot. The shots are inaccurate, which means that its shots could miss even if the player is standing still."
