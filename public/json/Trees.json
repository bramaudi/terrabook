    "<b>Trees</b> are the largest <linked>plants</linked> in <i><linked>Terraria</linked></i>, appearing mostly at the <linked>surface</linked> and often in clusters with similar height. Most trees can be chopped down with an <linked>axe</linked> or <linked>chainsaw</linked>, or destroyed with the use of <linked>explosives</linked> or by pouring <linked>lava</linked> on their bases. Destroying or chopping down a tree will yield many units of its respective <linked>Wood</linked>, an essential <linked>crafting material</linked>, and has a chance of dropping one or more <linked>Acorns</linked> that can be planted to grow more trees. Larger trees will yield more of these two items when removed; one unit of Wood will drop for each block of tree (including branches), and one Acorn may drop for each leaf patch.",
    "It is possible to cut off parts of the tree, but cutting at the lowermost center tile will destroy the entire tree. If parts of the tree are left, they will not regrow. Tiles beneath trees cannot be destroyed or <linked>actuated</linked>.",
    "Tree saplings can be <linked>painted</linked>, although this will not affect the tree at all. However, painting the blocks underneath the sapling will result in the tree being painted when it matures.",
    "Three other large plants do not drop Wood and spawn differently, but are otherwise treated similarly to trees. These are <linked>Giant Glowing Mushrooms</linked>, <linked>Cacti</linked> and <span class=\"eil\"><span><linked>Bamboo stalks</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span></span>."
