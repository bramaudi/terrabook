{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Trees","summaries":["<b>Trees</b> are the largest plants in <i>Terraria</i>, appearing mostly at the surface and often in clusters with similar height. Trees can be chopped down with an axe or chainsaw, or destroyed with the use of explosives or by pouring lava on their bases. Destroying or chopping down a tree will yield many units of its respective Wood, an essential crafting material, and has a chance of dropping one or more Acorns that can be planted to grow more trees. Larger trees will yield more of these two items when removed; one unit of Wood will drop for each block of tree (including branches), and one Acorn may drop for each leaf patch.","It is possible to cut off parts of the tree, but cutting at the lowermost center tile will destroy the entire tree. If parts of the tree are left, they will not regrow. Tiles beneath trees cannot be destroyed or actuated.","Tree saplings can be painted, although this will not affect the tree at all. However, painting the blocks underneath the sapling will result in the tree being painted when it matures.","Three other large plants do not drop Wood and spawn differently, but are otherwise treated similarly to trees. These are Giant Glowing Mushrooms, Cacti and <span class=\"eil\"><span>Bamboo stalks</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>."],"statistics":{},"crafts":{}}
