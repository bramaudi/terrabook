    "The <b>Houndius Shootius</b> is a <linked>pre-Hardmode</linked> <linked>sentry summon weapon</linked>. It can summon the <b>Houndius Shootius</b> <linked>sentry</linked>, which lasts for 10 minutes, remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. The Houndius Shootius shoots small fireballs at enemies from its floating eyeball that dissipate upon hitting an enemy or surface. The eyeball will always gaze toward the nearest player unless an enemy is close enough to attack, in which case it will gaze toward the targeted enemy. When used, the sentry will attempt to be summoned at the cursor, however, if used while the cursor is midair, the sentry will spawn on the closest blocks directly downwards of the cursor. The Houndius Shootius has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"25\">1/4 (25%)</span> chance of being dropped by <linked>Deerclops</linked>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifiers</linked> are <b>Mythical</b>, <b>Furious</b>, or <b>Godly</b>. Rounding reveals that these modifiers provide the same increase to damage as the Ruthless modifier, increasing it from 24 to 28."
