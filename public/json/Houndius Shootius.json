    "The <b>Houndius Shootius</b> is a <linked>pre-Hardmode</linked> <linked>sentry summon weapon</linked>. It can summon the <b>Houndius Shootius</b> <linked>sentry</linked>, which lasts for 10 minutes, remains stationary, and does not count against the player's minion capacity. It has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>25*</s>1/4 (25%)</span> chance to be dropped by <linked>Deerclops</linked>.",
    "When used, the sentry will attempt to summon at the cursor, however, if used while the cursor is midair, the sentry will spawn on the closest blocks directly downwards of the cursor.",
    "The Houndius Shootius shoots projectiles at enemies from a floating eyeball. The eyeball will point towards the player unless an enemy is close enough to attack, in which case it will point towards the enemy.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal <linked>critical hits</linked>. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Houndius Shootius has over a Ruthless one is <linked>knockback</linked>."
