    "The <b>Climbing Claws</b> are an accessory that lets players partially \"stick\" to the sides of blocks, slowly sliding down them when moving against them in midair. Jumps can also be performed off the sides of blocks. By repeatedly sticking and jumping, vertical blocks can be scaled. When sliding down, the slide speed can be accelerated using the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"S (PC default)\">▼ Down</span></kbd></span> key. Climbing Claws can be found in surface chests (including Water Chests) and they also have a <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.44*</s>1/225 (0.44%)</span> chance of being found in Wooden Crates and <span class=\"eil\"><span>Pearlwood Crates</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>. <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> It can also be purchased for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"2 Gold 50 Silver Coins\" data-sort-value=\"25000\"><span class=\"gc\">2</span><span class=\"sc\">50</span></span> from the Skeleton Merchant during a Waxing Crescent. Its availability very early in the game makes it a useful accessory for mobility, as it allows the player to slowly but surely climb up some walls without needing ropes.",
    "Climbing Claws function identically to the Shoe Spikes, but are found in different locations. When both Climbing Claws and Shoe Spikes are equipped, the wearer remains completely \"stuck\" at a fixed point when moving against the sides of blocks, and may slide down with the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"S (PC default)\">▼ Down</span></kbd></span> key. This effect can also be achieved using a single accessory if the Climbing Claws and Shoe Spikes are combined into the Tiger Climbing Gear at a Tinkerer's Workshop."
