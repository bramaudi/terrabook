    "The <b>Cabbage</b> summons a pet Guinea Pig when used. It grants the <b>Pet Guinea Pig</b> buff that lasts until the player manually cancels it (by going to the equip section of your inventory and pressing <span class=\"key\"><linked>A</linked></span> on the <linked>buff</linked>'s icon) or the player dies. The Guinea Pig will follow the player everywhere they go. Also, if the player has flying items (Wings, Rocket boots etc.), the Guinea Pig will fly with them. While flying it occasionally leaves white clouds behind itself.",
    "It is an uncommon drop from <linked>Dragon Snatchers</linked>. It can also rarely be obtained from <linked>Chests</linked> and <linked>Gold Chests</linked>."
