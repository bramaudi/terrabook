    "It fires a spread of eight bullets at a 45-degree angle while having twice the spread of the Shotgun. This spread is very substantial and it is difficult to aim without being right next to a foe due to its unreliable spread variation (although one of the pellets is always aimed towards the cursor accurately). However, it can be used against groups of enemies and can reliably hit bosses and bigger enemies.",
