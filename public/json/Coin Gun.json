    "The <b>Coin Gun</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>ranged weapon</linked> that uses <linked>coins</linked> as <linked>ammunition</linked>, which affects its damage and velocity depending on the type of coin fired. The weapon itself has 0 base damage, with the entirety of its damage value stemming from the coins used to fire it. Coin projectiles dissipate upon hitting an enemy or solid block and cannot be retrieved once fired.
