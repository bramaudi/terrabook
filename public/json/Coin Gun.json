    "The <b>Coin Gun</b> is a Hardmode ranged weapon that uses coins as ammunition, which cannot be retrieved once fired. Its damage and velocity depend on the type of coin fired. It is dropped very rarely (<span class=\"chance\"><s>0.0125*</s>1/8000 (0.0125%)</span> chance) by Pirate Invasion enemies, excluding the Parrot. The drop rate for the Pirate Captain is quadrupled (<span class=\"chance\"><s>0.05*</s>1/2000 (0.05%)</span> chance) and quintupled again with the Flying Dutchman (<span class=\"chance\"><s>0.25*</s>1/400 (0.25%)</span> chance).",
    "The Coin Gun cannot receive any modifiers that increase damage, so the modifier that boosts its <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr> the most is <b>Agile</b> (+12% speed, +3% critical strike chance). <b>Zealous</b> (+5% critical strike chance) serves as the most ammo-efficient option, dealing the greatest amount of damage per coin fired."
