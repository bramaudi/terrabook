  "summaries": [
    "<b>Jester's Arrows</b> are a type of <linked>arrow</linked>. They are considered an improvement over the <linked>Unholy Arrow</linked>, as they have no limit on the number of <linked>enemies</linked> they can pierce. This makes them efficient against enemies with multiple sections such as the <linked>Eater of Worlds</linked>. Due to their piercing effect, they can sometimes be better than stronger arrows, such as the <linked>Hellfire Arrow</linked>. They also emit light when fired, meaning they can be used to temporarily light up caves. However, Jester's Arrows will explode in a firework effect after hitting something or reaching their maximum range. This means that, unlike other arrows, they can not be recovered after hitting an enemy or a wall (As of 1.4, no arrows can be recovered after being fired).",
    "In addition to being crafted, Jester's Arrows can also be found in <linked>Gold Chests</linked> in the <linked>Underground</linked> and <linked>Cavern</linked> <linked>layers</linked>."
