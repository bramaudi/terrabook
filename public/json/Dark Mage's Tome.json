{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Dark Mage's Tome","summaries":["The <b>Dark Mage's Tome</b> is a mount-summon item that places the player on a <b>Book Mount</b> similar to the one ridden by the Dark Mage during the Old One's Army event. It is dropped by the Dark Mage in Master Mode only.","The mount allows a player to hover and glide at a fixed height of 8 tiles high in mid-air for 5 seconds following a jump or walking off a ledge. It otherwise glides along the ground. Whether on the ground or hovering, its top speed is <abbr title=\"41 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 30 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">41 mph</span></abbr>.","The max height of the mount can be increased using items that allow for multiple jumps such as the Cloud in a Bottle, though this only allows it to be multiplied by the number of times the player jumps. The altitude of the mount is also adjustable in the down direction by pressing <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"S (PC default)\">▼ Down</span></kbd></span>.","The Book Mount cancels fall damage."],"statistics":{"Use time":"20 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Summons a magic tome mount<br>'A book said to be at its holder's behest.'</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: Fiery red]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"50000\"><span class=\"gc\">5</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
