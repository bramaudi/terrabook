    "<b>Zombies</b> are common surface enemies that appear at night and are a primary reason newer players will want to build a shelter before night arrives. Along with Demon Eyes, they are generally among the first night enemies a player will encounter, as they appear in areas a player first spawns. Multiple NPCs living in the area will reduce or prevent local enemy spawns, including Zombies.",
    "Zombies follow the Fighter AI and walk towards the player, dealing damage on contact. They can jump and navigate platforms. Zombies will seem to hit closed doors in their path repeatedly, though most of them cannot open Doors unless it is a Blood Moon (during which Blood Zombies will spawn and be able to open doors); Spore Zombies can open doors at any time.",
    "In <span class=\"eil\"><span>Expert Mode</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>, some Zombies carry disembodied arms. These deal more damage on contact than other zombies and will stop to perform a \"slashing\" animation when near the player, extending the range at which they can damage the player. These arm-wielding zombies are unable to open or interact with doors at any time."
