{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Goblin Battle Standard","summaries":["The <b>Goblin Battle Standard</b> is an item that summons a Goblin Army when used. This can be useful for farming Spiky Balls or in a world where you need to obtain the Goblin Tinkerer and don't want to wait for the random Goblin Army event. It is also useful in Hardmode for farming Goblin Warlocks and the shadowflame weapons they drop. The Goblin Battle Standard is consumed when used, so one must be crafted for each invasion the player wishes to summon.","The Tattered Cloth required for crafting the Goblin Battle Standard is obtained by killing Goblin Scouts which spawn occasionally in the East and West thirds of the world.","In order for it to be used, at least one player must have 200 health or more."],"statistics":{"Consumable":"<span class=\"t-yes\">✔️</span>","Use time":"45 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very slow)</span>","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Summons a Goblin Army</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 0]</span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">3 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{"Recipes":[{"result":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i multi-line\">[img:Goblin Battle Standard]<span><span>Goblin Battle Standard</span></span></span>"},"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Tattered Cloth]<span><span>Tattered Cloth</span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(10)</span></li><li><span class=\"i\">[img:Any Wood]<span><span>Any Wood</span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(5)</span></li></ul>"},"station":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i\">[img:Loom]<span><span>Loom</span></span></span>"}}]}}
