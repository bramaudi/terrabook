    "The <b>Sand Elemental</b> is a rare <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>enemy</linked> which spawns in the <linked>Desert</linked> during a <linked>Sandstorm</linked>. She is guaranteed to drop a <linked>Forbidden Fragment</linked>, the main ingredient for the <linked>Forbidden armor</linked> as well as the <linked>Spirit Flame</linked>.",
    "The Sand Elemental attacks by summoning three Ancient Storms randomly around the general location of the player, which last 5 seconds. The distance between them varies, and they remain stationary for their lifespan. The Sand Elemental cannot travel through <linked>blocks</linked>, and flies in a non-linear pattern. She attempts to move towards the player and gets faster as her health depletes.",
    "She is one of the few entities that can be detected by the <linked>Lifeform Analyzer</linked> or its upgrades. The Sand Elemental requires 25 kills to be awarded completion of her <linked>Bestiary</linked> entry and corresponding banner, as opposed to the usual 50 kills."
