    "The <b>Traveling Merchant</b> is a unique NPC vendor who randomly visits the player's town for one day. His inventory is randomized and different every visit, selling 4–10 / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\">4–12</abbr> (average 5.47 / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\">5.97</abbr>; see below for details) different items listed below.",
    "In order for the Traveling Merchant to spawn, at least 2 other NPCs must already be present. The Guide counts as one of these, but the Old Man and <span class=\"eil\"><span>Skeleton Merchant</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span> do not. He will not spawn during Solar Eclipses, the Goblin Army, Frost Legion, Pirate Invasion, or Martian Madness. He does not require his own house in order to spawn, and will instead spawn next to NPCs, including town pets, spending the day walking around them.",
    "Once the criteria are met, the Traveling Merchant has a 22.12% chance of spawning each day, appearing at a random time between 4:30 AM and 12:00 PM. The chances of him spawning are always the same regardless if the player is sleeping. He leaves the same day at 6:00 PM, but can only do so once he is off-screen. He despawns if the world is vacated any time after he spawns.",
    "<span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> If threatened by enemies, the Traveling Merchant will defend himself with a Revolver. Once Hardmode begins, he upgrades to a Pulse Bow."
