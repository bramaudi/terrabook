    "<b>Beeswax</b> is a <linked>pet</linked>-summoning item that spawns a <b>Tiphia</b> when used. It grants the <b>Pet Tiphia</b> buff that lasts until the player manually cancels it by selecting the buff's icon in the buff menu, or if the player dies. The pet can deal 1â€“5 damage to an enemy if it runs into one, although it will not follow it.",
    "It is an uncommon drop from <linked>Dragon Hornets</linked>. It can also rarely be obtained from <linked>Gold Chests</linked> and <linked>Ivy Chests</linked> in the <linked>Underground Jungle</linked>.",
