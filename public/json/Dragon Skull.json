    "The <b>Cursed Skull</b> (and the <b>Dragon Skull</b> on [img:Old-gen console version] Old-gen console and 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version]) is a flying enemy found only in the Dungeon. It is similar to the Meteor Head, with high damage, slow speed, and the ability to travel through tiles. It floats slowly towards the player, occasionally stopping to float in a circle around them for a while, before suddenly lunging forward to attack, similar to the Eye of Cthulhu. When striking a player, the Cursed Skull has a decent chance to apply the Cursed debuff. This renders the player unable to use items, including Weapons, Potions, and Grappling Hooks, making it very difficult to avoid further damage.",
    "They are much more likely to appear in Dungeon areas where there are Brick Walls."
