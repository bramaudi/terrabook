    "The <b>Cursed Skull</b> (and the <b>Dragon Skull</b> on <linked>[img:Old-gen console version]</linked><linked> Old-gen console</linked> and <linked>3DS</linked><linked>[img:Nintendo 3DS version]</linked>) is a flying <linked>enemy</linked> found only in the <linked>Dungeon</linked>. It is similar to the <linked>Meteor Head</linked>, with high damage, slow speed, and the ability to travel through tiles. It floats slowly towards the player, occasionally stopping to float in a circle around them for a while, before suddenly lunging forward to attack, similar to the <linked>Eye of Cthulhu</linked>. When striking a player, the Cursed Skull has a decent chance to apply the <linked>Cursed</linked> <linked>debuff</linked>. This renders the player unable to use items, including <linked>Weapons</linked>, <linked>Potions</linked>, and <linked>Grappling Hooks</linked>, making it very difficult to avoid further damage.",
    "They are much more likely to appear in Dungeon areas where there are <linked>Brick Walls</linked>."
