{"type":"weapons","title":"Piranha Gun","summaries":["The <b>Piranha Gun</b> is a Hardmode post-Plantera ranged weapon that fires three <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / a single <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> returning Mechanical Piranha projectile(s) that costs no ammunition. The mechanical fish will stick onto an enemy to do continuous damage while the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Left Click (PC default): Use held item or attack\">âš’ Use / Attack</span></kbd></span> button is held. Each can target different enemies, or the same one, if there are too few nearby. If the initial target is killed and the button is still held, the projectiles will seek out nearby enemies. It returns to the gun once no other enemies are in the vicinity, when the button is released, or after one minute of continuous use. The Piranha Gun is found in the Dungeon's Jungle Chest, which requires the Jungle Key to open, and only after Plantera has been defeated.","The first enemy the piranha attaches to must be in direct line of sight. However, any other nearby enemy besides the first target will not require a line of sight. It hits 7.5 times per second and deals damage in a very small area, meaning that if other enemies get too close they can also be damaged simultaneously.","Its best modifier is <b>Unreal</b>. Because its attack speed is unaffected by modifiers, <b>Godly</b> and <b>Demonic</b> can also be considered the best modifiers for a Piranha Gun."],"statistics":{"Damage":"38 <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / 33 <span class=\"eico s i3 i5\" title=\"Old-gen console and 3DS versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> <span class=\"small-bold\">(Ranged)</span>","Knockback":"1 <span class=\"knockback\">(Extremely weak)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"30 <span class=\"usetime\">(Average)</span>","Velocity":"14","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Latches on to enemies for continuous damage</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 8]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"20 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"200000\"><span class=\"gc\">20</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
