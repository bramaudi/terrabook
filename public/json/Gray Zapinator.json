It is only available once the Eye of Cthulhu, Eater of Worlds/Brain of Cthulhu, Queen Bee, or Skeletron has been defeated. Unlike the Zapinator, the Gray Zapinator does not autofire. Meteor armor's set bonus will reduce the mana cost of the Gray Zapinator (and Orange Zapinator) to 0, although the stated mana cost will not change.","The weapon fires a laser beam which behaves very erratically. Upon striking an enemy, the projectile slows down by 40%, decreases its current damage and knockback by 10%, and can choose from an assortment of special effects as described below. The laser beam will disappear after hitting eight enemies or after 60 seconds.","Its best modifier is <b>Mythical</b>."],"statistics":{"Damage":"42 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Magic)</span>","Knockback":"6 <span class=\"knockback\">(Average)</span>","Mana":"16","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"36 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very slow)</span>","Velocity":"60<small> (effective)</small>","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">'It might be broken'</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 2]</span>","Buy":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"17 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"170000\"><span class=\"gc\">17</span></span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"3 Gold 40 Silver Coins\" data-sort-value=\"34000\"><span class=\"gc\">3</span><span class=\"sc\">40</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
