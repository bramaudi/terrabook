    "The <b>Companion Cube</b> is a pet summoning item. It has a chance of being sold by the Traveling Merchant for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Platinum Coins\" data-sort-value=\"5000000\"><span class=\"pc\">5</span></span>. It summons a <b>Companion Cube</b> pet that will jump around the player frantically.",
    "When the player and the Companion Cube are in complete darkness, the Cube can occasionally \"stab\" its owner, inflicting 3 damage. The stab can eventually kill the owner, displaying the unique death message <i>\"<span class=\"gameText\">&lt;Player name&gt; was stabbed.</span>\"</i> Portable light sources, such as Torches or light pets, will completely remove chances of being stabbed by the Companion Cube.",
    "When the Companion Cube falls into lava, it emits the Lunatic Cultist's death sound. When submerged in lava for long enough, there is a chance it may make the Moon Lord's death sound. The Companion Cube will also occasionally emit the flatulence sound normally produced by the Whoopie Cushion and its upgrades."
