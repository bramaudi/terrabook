    "The <b>Goat Skull</b> is a Hardmode mount-summoning item dropped by the Wall of Flesh in Master Mode with a <span class=\"chance\"><s>25*</s>1/4 (25%)</span> chance to drop. When used, it summons a rideable <b>Goat Mount</b> which allows the mounted player to perform a double jump, similar to the Cloud in a Bottle.",
    "Once a high speed is reached, the Goat Mount leaves a fire trail behind, and from that point on, it will be able to damage enemies on contact. The invulnerability is granted for 1/10th of a second when the player and the Goat Mount dash through an enemy, much like the brief invulnerability after taking damage."
