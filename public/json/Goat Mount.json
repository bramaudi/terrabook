When used, it summons a rideable <b>Goat Mount</b> which allows the mounted player to perform a double jump, similar to the <linked>Cloud in a Bottle</linked>.",
    "Once a high enough speed is reached, the Goat Mount leaves a trail of fire on solid blocks behind itself, similar to <linked>Flame Walker Boots</linked>, and from that point on, it will be able to damage <linked>enemies</linked> on contact. The invulnerability is granted for 1/10th of a second when the player and the Goat Mount dash through an enemy, much like the brief invulnerability after taking damage."
