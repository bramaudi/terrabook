    "The <b>Sandcastle Bucket</b> is a tool that places a decorative sandcastle and consumes one Sand Block upon use. It can be used on all variants of Sand Blocks and platforms, in any biome. Sandcastles are background furniture objects, but they cannot be picked up; using a pickaxe or drill on them destroys them immediately.",
    "The Sandcastle Bucket can be found randomly in Water Chests, Ocean Crates, and Seaside Crates.",
    "When the cursor is moved over a valid block, one out of four sandcastle styles will be selected randomly. Moving the cursor over a different block will produce a different sandcastle preview, so players can choose the particular sandcastle variant they wish to place by moving their cursor back and forth."
