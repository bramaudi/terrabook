    "The <b>Sandcastle Bucket</b> is a <linked>tool</linked> that places a decorative sandcastle and consumes one <linked>Sand Block</linked> upon use. It can be used on all variants of Sand Blocks and <linked>platforms</linked>, in any <linked>biome</linked>. Sandcastles are background <linked>furniture</linked> objects, but they cannot be picked up; using a <linked>pickaxe</linked> or <linked>drill</linked> on them destroys them immediately.",
    "The Sandcastle Bucket can be found randomly in <linked>Water Chests</linked>, <linked>Ocean Crates</linked>, and <linked>Seaside Crates</linked>.",
    "When the <linked>cursor</linked> is moved over a valid <linked>block</linked>, one out of four sandcastle styles will be selected randomly. Moving the cursor over a different block will produce a different sandcastle preview, so players can choose the particular sandcastle variant they wish to place by moving their cursor back and forth."
