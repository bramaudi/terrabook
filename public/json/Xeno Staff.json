{"type":"weapons","title":"Xeno Staff","summaries":["The <b>Xeno Staff</b> is a Hardmode, post-Golem summon weapon. It summons a <b>UFO</b> minion that teleports to nearby enemies and fires lasers at them. The UFO is capable of moving through blocks when far away from the character. It is dropped by the Martian Saucer during the Martian Madness event.","Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Xeno Staff has over a Ruthless one is knockback."],"statistics":{"Damage":"36 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Summon)</span>","Knockback":"2 <span class=\"knockback\">(Very weak)</span>","Mana":"10","Use time":"36 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very slow)</span> <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / 33 <span class=\"usetime\">(Slow)</span> <span class=\"eico s i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span>","Velocity":"10","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Summons a UFO to fight for you</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 8]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"10 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"100000\"><span class=\"gc\">10</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
