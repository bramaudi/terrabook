    "The <b>Terraprisma</b> is a Hardmode, post-Plantera summon weapon. It spawns a detached copy of itself that rapidly attacks nearby enemies. It is a guaranteed drop from the Empress of Light when all damage dealt to the Empress occurs during the day.",
    "It is thought to be one of the hardest summons to acquire in the entire game, as the Empress of Light will one-shot the player with any attack during the day, but is also one of the best summons in the game due to its unique and powerful attacks.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal critical hits. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Terraprisma has over a Ruthless one is knockback."
