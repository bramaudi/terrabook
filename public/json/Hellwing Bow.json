    "The <b>Hellwing Bow</b> is a <linked>pre-Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Skeletron</linked> <linked>bow</linked> that fires <linked>arrows</linked> in a ~30Â° cone, which causes it to be very inaccurate at long distances. In addition, <linked>Wooden Arrows</linked> are converted into Hellwings, flaming bat projectiles that travel in a semi-straight line, can pierce infinitely, and will dissipate once hitting a surface. All other arrow types are not converted and will retain their special properties. The Hellwing Bow has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"20\">1/5 (20%)</span> chance of being found in <linked>Shadow Chests</linked> in the <linked>Underworld</linked>, as well as a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"20\">1/5 (20%)</span> chance of being found in <linked>Obsidian Lock Boxes</linked> obtained from <linked>Obsidian Crates</linked> and <linked>Hellstone Crates</linked>.",
