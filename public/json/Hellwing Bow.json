    "The <b>Hellwing Bow</b> is a <linked>bow</linked> found in <linked>Shadow Chests</linked> in the Underworld and in <linked>Obsidian Lock Boxes</linked> obtained from <linked>Obsidian</linked> and <linked>Hellstone Crates</linked>. All <linked>arrows</linked> are fired in a ~30Â° cone from the Hellwing Bow which causes it to be very inaccurate at long distances. In addition, <linked>Wooden Arrows</linked> are converted into Hellwings, flaming bat projectiles that travel in a semi-straight line, can pierce infinitely, and will dissipate once hitting a surface. All other arrow types are not converted and will retain their special properties.",
