{"type":"weapons","title":"Hellwing Bow","summaries":["The <b>Hellwing Bow</b> is a bow found in Shadow Chests found in the Underworld. On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, it can also be found in the Obsidian Lock Box obtainable in Obsidian and Hellstone Crates. It converts normal Wooden Arrows into flaming bat projectiles that travel in a semi-straight line and can pierce infinitely. This is countered by the fact that the bats are fired in a ~30Â° cone and therefore can be very inaccurate at long distances. Additionally, the bats will dissipate once hitting a surface. Other arrows will not lose their special properties, but will inherit the inaccuracy of the bow.","Its best modifier is <b>Unreal</b>."],"statistics":{"Uses ammo":"Arrows","Damage":"22 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Ranged)</span>","Knockback":"5.5 <span class=\"knockback\">(Average)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"13 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Velocity":"6","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Wooden arrows turn into flaming bats</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 3]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"2 Gold 50 Silver Coins\" data-sort-value=\"25000\"><span class=\"gc\">2</span><span class=\"sc\">50</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
