    "The <b>Cannon</b> is an interactive furniture item purchased from the Pirate for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"25 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"250000\"><span class=\"gc\">25</span></span>. It can be placed on the ground and, when activated, either by a Player (consuming a Cannonball) or by wire (<span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span>), fires an arcing cannonball that explodes on contact, dealing heavy damage without destroying blocks. The Cannon is powerful but immobile, functioning as a fixed gun emplacement, and so is best suited for tasks such as home defense.",
    "A more powerful version of the Cannon known as the Bunny Cannon is sold by the Pirate when the Party Girl is present and one Hardmode boss (Not including Queen Slime <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span>) is defeated."
