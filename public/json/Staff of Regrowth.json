    "The <b>Staff of Regrowth</b> is a unique planting tool that can be found in Jungle Crates (19% chance), and also in Ivy Chests (22.5% chance) located in Jungle Shrines and at the base of a Living Mahogany Tree in the Underground Jungle. It increases the yield of herbs and seeds when harvested. When harvesting plants from Clay Pots or Planter Boxes, only blooming herbs that would drop seeds can be cut. When harvesting plants from natural blocks in Singleplayer mode, immature sprouts will be destroyed and plants that are fully grown but not in bloom will drop seeds.",
    "When used on Dirt Blocks, Grass will be planted without the need for seeds. <span class=\"eico i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span> The Staff of Regrowth can also be used to grow Moss on stone. The type of moss will vary depending on the proximity to other types of moss, with the range for moss color being 27. As such, one can spread the Fire Moss from the cavern's lava layers all the way up to the surface.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Light</b> for harvesting purposes and <b>Legendary</b> for combat purposes."
