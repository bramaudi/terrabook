    "The <b>Bottomless Honey Bucket</b> is an item that functions similarly to the standard Honey Bucket, the only differences being that it never needs refilling (and cannot be filled), it can be used an infinite number of times, has a slightly extended range, and can place honey slightly faster than a standard bucket. It is a quest reward from the Angler upon completing a fishing quest where the quest item is a Bumblebee Tuna. It has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>50*</s>1/2 (50%)</span> chance to be awarded, where it is then decided whether the provided item will be either a Bottomless Honey Bucket or a Honey Absorbant Sponge. In Hardmode, the initial chance for the items do not apply, causing either item to be guaranteed.",
    "This is the honey counterpart of the Bottomless Water Bucket, Bottomless Lava Bucket, and Bottomless Shimmer Bucket"
