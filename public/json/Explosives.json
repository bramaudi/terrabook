    "<b>Explosives</b> are a placeable, consumable mechanism that can be triggered using wiring. Triggering them causes a large, circular explosion that covers a radius of ten tiles (up to 314 blocks total), destroying most placed blocks and items (except for explosion-proof items), and inflicting 500 base damage and a knockback of 10 <span>(Extremely strong)</span> to entities. Therefore, they can kill or severely damage even players with late-game gear.",
