    "The <b>Red Ryder</b> is a <linked>gun</linked> dropped from <linked>Presents</linked> obtained during <linked>Christmas</linked>, with a 0.643% chance in <linked>pre-Hardmode</linked> and 0.56% chance in <linked>Hardmode</linked>. It is similar to the <linked>Musket</linked>, although it does less damage. Its low speed and damage make it a very low-tier gun. However, it can potentially be obtained very early in the game, is better than most early-game <linked>bows</linked>, and it fulfills the criteria for the <linked>Arms Dealer</linked> to move in, making it an exceptional starting weapon.",
