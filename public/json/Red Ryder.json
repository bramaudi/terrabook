    "The <b>Red Ryder</b> is a gun dropped from Presents obtained during Christmas, with a 0.643% chance in pre-Hardmode and 0.56% chance in Hardmode. It is similar to the Musket, although it does less damage. Its low speed and damage make it a very low-tier gun. However, it can potentially be obtained very early in the game, is better than most early-game bows, and it fulfills the criteria for the Arms Dealer to move in, making it an exceptional starting weapon.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Unreal</b>."
