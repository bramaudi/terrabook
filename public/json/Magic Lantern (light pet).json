    "The <b>Magic Lantern</b> is a <linked>light pet-summoning</linked> item that spawns a small glowing <b>Magic Lantern</b> which hovers above the player, emitting dim yellow light. The lantern will also expose all treasure within up to 15 tiles from the lantern's location, overlaying small yellow sparkles over nearby valuable treasure, which is the same as what is highlighted by a <linked>Spelunker Potion</linked>. The Magic Lantern can be purchased from the <linked>Skeleton Merchant</linked> for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"10 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"100000\"><span class=\"gc\">10<i> GC</i></span></span> during the night of a <linked>full moon</linked>.",
    "The lantern will always try to maintain a position just forward of and above the player, passing through blocks as needed. If the player is far enough away or in midair, the lantern will propel itself with a rocket exhaust in order to catch up to them. The lantern's position can block objects of interest at ceiling height, but if the player just turns around, the lantern will move to their other side."
