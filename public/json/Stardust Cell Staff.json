{"type":"weapons","title":"Stardust Cell Staff","summaries":["The <b>Stardust Cell Staff</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Lunatic Cultist</linked> <linked>summon weapon</linked> that summons a Stardust Cell (a minion version of the <linked>Star Cell</linked> enemy) that can perform a ranged attack and will teleport to enemies out of range. Like other <linked>minions</linked>, the summoned Stardust Cell is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the <linked>buff</linked>, or leaves the world.","The Stardust Cell's ranged attack consists of firing a miniature version of itself at an enemy target that it latches onto and deals damage over time to. This damage ticks 30 times before the mini-cell vanishes, and can be stacked as the Stardust Cell continues to fire additional mini-cells onto the target, able to stack for up to 100 damage per \"tick\". Additionally, the Stardust Cell will occasionally fire an extra shot at any target the player is attacking, without interrupting their standard rate of fire, even if the Stardust Cell is already currently attacking that target. This makes the Stardust Cell Staff very effective at attacking targets with high health.","After teleporting at an enemy, a Stardust Cell will instantly fire a mini-cell.","Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal <linked>critical hits</linked>. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Stardust Cell Staff has over a Ruthless one is <linked>knockback</linked>."],"statistics":{"Damage":"60 <span class=\"small-bold\">(Summon)</span>","Knockback":"2 <span class=\"knockback\">(Very weak)</span>","Mana":"10","Use time":"36 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very slow)</span>","Velocity":"10","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Summons a stardust cell to fight for you<br>'Cultivate the most beautiful cellular infection'</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\"><linked>[img:Rarity level: 10]</linked></span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"10 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"100000\"><span class=\"gc\">10</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{"Recipes":[{"result":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i multi-line\"><linked>[img:Stardust Cell Staff]</linked><span><span><linked>Stardust Cell Staff</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span>"},"ingredients":{"value":"<ul><li><span class=\"i\"><linked>[img:Stardust Fragment]</linked><span><span><linked>Stardust Fragment</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span> <span class=\"note-text\">(18)</span></li></ul>"},"station":{"rowspan":1,"value":"<span class=\"i -w\"><linked>[img:Ancient Manipulator]</linked><span><span><linked>Ancient Manipulator</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4 i6\" title=\"Desktop, Console, Mobile and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span></span>"}}]}}
