    "The <b>Stardust Cell Staff</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Lunatic Cultist</linked> <linked>summon weapon</linked> that summons a <b>Stardust Cell</b> (a <linked>minion</linked> version of the <linked>Star Cell</linked> enemy) that can perform ranged attacks and will teleport to enemies out of range. Like other <linked>minions</linked>, the summoned Stardust Cell is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the <linked>buff</linked>, or leaves the world.",
    "The Stardust Cell's ranged attack consists of firing a mini-cell at an enemy target, dealing 100% base damage (60 base damage). The mini-cell attaches to the target afterward, inflicts it with the <b>Celled</b> <linked>debuff</linked>, and deals damage based on the number of attached mini-cells over time. A maximum of 10 mini-cells can attach to one target at the same time, and each mini-cell attached to the target deals 20 damage per second for 5 seconds. As a result, the maximum damage is 200 damage per second. Additionally, the Stardust Cell will occasionally fire an extra shot at any target the player is attacking, without interrupting their standard rate of fire, even if the Stardust Cell is already currently attacking that target.",
    "After teleporting at an enemy, a Stardust Cell will instantly fire a mini-cell.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The Mythical modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but these primarily affect the initial summon rather than the resulting minion. Additionally, minions cannot deal <linked>critical hits</linked>. The only lasting advantage a Mythical Stardust Cell Staff has over a Ruthless one is <linked>knockback</linked>."
