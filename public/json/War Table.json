    "The <b>War Table</b> is an animated <linked>furniture</linked> item that is dropped by the <linked>Dark Mage</linked> during the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> <linked>event</linked>. During the last Tier 1 wave, it has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"50\">1/2 (50%)</span> / <linked>1/1 (100%)</linked> chance to drop; during the fourth and sixth Tier 3 waves, it has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"12.5\">1/8 (12.5%)</span> / <linked>1/4 (25%)</linked> chance to drop.",
    "Placing and pressing <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚷ Open / Activate</linked></span> on the War Table grants the <b>Strategist</b> <linked>buff</linked>, which increases the player's <linked>sentry</linked> capacity by 1. This lasts until the player <linked>dies</linked> or leaves the world, but can be canceled at any time  by right-clicking the icon (<linked>[img:Desktop version]</linked>),  by selecting the icon using Cycle Next/Previous Buff and then pressing Remove Buff (<linked>[img:Console version]</linked>), or  by double-tapping the buff icon (<linked>[img:Mobile version]</linked>).",
    "Unlike <linked>equipment buff items</linked>, the War Table must be placed in order to activate the buff. It can be mined with a <linked>pickaxe</linked> or <linked>drill</linked> and picked up again, even while the buff is active, which will not cancel the buff. Placement is only dependent on an adequate space of 5×4 tiles being available."
