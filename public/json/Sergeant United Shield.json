    "The <b>Sergeant United Shield</b> is a Hardmode boomerang. Only one can be thrown at a time. It automatically homes in on nearby enemies and will chain its attack to 4 additional enemies, however it will not hit an enemy more than once per throw. It is rarely sold by the Traveling Merchant for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"35 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"350000\"><span class=\"gc\">35</span></span>.",
    "With any equipped shield (including the Sergeant United Shield when not thrown) and holding this weapon, pressing the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Right Click (PC default): Activate environment object or talk to NPC\">âš· Open / Activate</span></kbd></span> button will cause the character to brace for the next attack. When timed correctly, just before taking a hit, the enemy's attack will be parried (see Notes for details about the parry), dealing some damage to the attacker and granting the Striking Moment buff for the next 5 seconds. This allows the next melee attack to deal 5 times the damage. Alternatively, if the shield is held in place, 20 defense is temporarily gained; this lasts until the shield is once again lowered.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
