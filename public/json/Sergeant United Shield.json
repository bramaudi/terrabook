    "The <b>Sergeant United Shield</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>boomerang</linked> that automatically homes in on nearby enemies and will attempt to hit up to four additional enemies before returning to the player. However, it will never hit an enemy more than once per throw and only one can be thrown at a time. Additionally, it allows the player to \"parry\" incoming damage when equipped with a <linked>shield</linked> (including the Sergeant United Shield itself, while it is not thrown).",
    "While holding the Sergeant United Shield with any equipped shield, pressing the <span class=\"key\"><linked>âš· Open / Activate</linked></span> button will cause the player to raise the shield and brace for the next attack. When timed correctly, just before taking a hit, the <linked>enemy</linked>'s attack will be parried, which negates the contact damage being dealt to the player, deals 200% of the contact damage of the attacking enemy, inflicts a knockback value of 5 <span class=\"knockback\">(Average)</span>, and grants the player 30 <linked>invincibility frames</linked> (60 with the <linked>Cross Necklace</linked> equipped). Successfully parrying an attack also grants the <linked>Striking Moment</linked> <linked>buff</linked>, causing the next <linked>melee-based</linked> attack to deal 500% or five times its usual base damage for the next five seconds. Alternatively, if the shield is held in place, 20 <linked>defense</linked> is temporarily gained; this lasts until the shield is once again lowered. The Sergeant United Shield is rarely sold by the <linked>Traveling Merchant</linked> for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"35 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"350000\"><span class=\"gc\">35<i> GC</i></span></span>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
