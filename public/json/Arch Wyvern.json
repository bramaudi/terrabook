    "They will follow descending players down to ground level and can fly through <linked>blocks</linked>, but regular Wyverns tend not to fly below ground.",
    "Wyverns will only spawn when the player is above a certain altitude (see <linked>Space § Notes</linked>). Outside of <linked>the Crimson</linked>, <linked>Corruption</linked>, and <linked>Dungeon</linked> biomes, and except during <linked>events</linked>, having at least one <linked>NPC</linked> near the player will also prevent them from spawning. A Wyvern will not spawn if another one is already alive, and like most enemies able to pass through blocks, it will not be able to spawn if the player themselves stays in front of <linked>safe walls</linked>, even if there are valid spawn points for the Wyvern."
