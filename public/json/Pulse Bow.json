    "The <b>Pulse Bow</b> is a unique post-Mechanical Boss Hardmode bow that auto-fires a high-velocity glowing light blue bolt, which is unaffected by gravity, will pierce enemies, can ricochet, and flies for 3.5 seconds (about 480 tiles) before dissipating. It is purchased from the Traveling Merchant for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"45 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"450000\"><span class=\"gc\">45</span></span>.",
    "The projectile can pierce or ricochet five times in total, dissipating upon the sixth hit. Each ricochet causes the bolt to pierce one less enemy and vice versa.",
    "Like other bows and repeaters, it can use any arrow type as ammunition.  However, the Pulse Bow converts all arrows to its special bolt. Normal effects of various arrow types are canceled, except for their damage statistic. The Pulse Bow has a base 11% critical strike chance as opposed to the usual 4%.",
