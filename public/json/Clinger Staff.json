    "The <b>Clinger Staff</b> is a Hardmode magic weapon that has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>20*</s>1/5 (20%)</span> chance to be dropped by a Corrupt Mimic. It generates a 15-tiles high wall of Cursed Flame, which deals damage and <span class=\"eico i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> inflicts the Cursed Inferno debuff to any enemy that walks through it. The point at which the wall is generated must be in a direct line of sight; otherwise, the wall will not generate, though still consume mana. The Clinger Staff's wall lasts for about 5 minutes. Only one wall may be generated at a time; if another is summoned, the first one will vanish.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Ruthless</b>. The <b>Mythical</b> modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but the only stats that improve damage output are damage and critical chance. Switching to a different magic weapon causes existing projectiles to use that weapon's critical chance instead, meaning that the Clinger Staff's <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr> is optimized with the Ruthless modifier when used in the intended way."
