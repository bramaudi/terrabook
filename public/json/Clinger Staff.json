    "The <b>Clinger Staff</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>magic weapon</linked> that generates a 15-tile high wall of <linked>Cursed Flame</linked>, which deals damage and inflicts the <linked>Cursed Inferno</linked> debuff to any <linked>enemy</linked> that walks through it for a duration of 7 seconds. The point at which the wall is generated must be in a direct line of sight; otherwise, the wall will not generate, though still consume <linked>mana</linked>. The Clinger Staff's wall lasts for about 5 minutes. Only one wall may be generated at a time; if another is summoned, the first one will vanish. The Clinger Staff has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"20\">1/5 (20%)</span> chance of being dropped by <linked>Corrupt Mimics</linked>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Ruthless</b>. The <b>Mythical</b> modifier provides the widest array of stat bonuses, but the only stats that improve damage output are damage and critical chance. Switching to a different magic weapon causes existing projectiles to use that weapon's critical chance instead, meaning that the Clinger Staff's <abbr title=\"Damage per second\">DPS</abbr> is optimized with the Ruthless modifier when used in the intended way."
