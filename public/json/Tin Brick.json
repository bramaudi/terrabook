    "<b>Tin Brick</b> is a type of Brick and an aesthetic building material made from Tin Ore. In some worlds it can also be harvested from Jungle Shrines. Like the ore it is made of, placed Tin Bricks will sparkle. As tin becomes fairly useless early in the game, this is an inexpensive ore brick to build with. Despite being made of Tin, it has no sell value, as with most other blocks. Tin Plating is also available as a decorative block, with the same ingredients and color but a different texture."
