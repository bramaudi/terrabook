    "The <b>Goblin Tinkerer</b> is an NPC that sells several unique items and provides the reforge function. He can be acquired after a Goblin Army has been defeated, spawning randomly in open areas in the Cavern layer. He will appear as the stationary <b>Bound Goblin</b> at first, and talking to him in this state will free him. If the Bound Goblin is killed, he will still be able to respawn afterwards; if the Goblin Tinkerer NPC is killed, he will move in again after some time as long as there is a vacant house.",
    "The Goblin Tinkerer's reforge option allows the player to randomize the modifier for a weapon or accessory, which can make the item better or worse than it was originally. Reforges cost one-third of the item's current value, which can also be affected by its current modifier. The reforge cost is also affected by the Goblin Tinkerer's <span class=\"eil\"><span>happiness</span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span></span>, and can be decreased by equipping a Discount Card or Greedy Ring.",
