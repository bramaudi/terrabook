It can be purchased from the Pirate for <span class=\"coin\" title=\"50 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"500000\"><span class=\"gc\">50</span></span> when the Party Girl is present and one of the mechanical bosses has been defeated. It works like a Cannon, albeit firing Explosive Bunnies instead of Cannonballs.",

Depending on where the wire is connected, it will either shoot an Explosive Bunny or rotate toward the side the wire is on. Note that Explosive Bunnies fired by this way is purely aesthetic and will not deal damage."
