    "The <b>Bottomless Lava Bucket</b> is an item that functions similarly to the standard Lava Bucket, except that it never runs out of Lava and can place it slightly faster than a regular lava bucket (especially when moving the cursor around while filling). It is obtained as a rare drop from fishing in lava.",
    "This is the lava counterpart of the Bottomless Water Bucket, Bottomless Honey Bucket, and Bottomless Shimmer Bucket."
