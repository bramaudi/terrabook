    "The <b>Flinx Staff</b> is a pre-Hardmode summon weapon that summons a <b>Flinx</b> minion. Upon hitting an enemy, it bounces off creating a small puff of blue smoke where it immediately tries to hit the enemy again. Sometimes it will not bounce far enough away from the enemy, and will deal damage two times within just a few frames. If the player gets too far away, goes behind a wall, or flies up in the air, the Flinx will twirl end over end towards the player. Like other minions, the summoned Flinx is invincible and follows the player for an unlimited amount of time, unless the player dies, summons a replacement minion, cancels the buff, or leaves the world.",
    "Visually, the minion looks like a purple-colored Snow Flinx with a bun of fur behind its head.",
    "Unlike other summon weapons, its best possible modifier is <b>Mythical</b> because both the Ruthless and Mythical modifiers only raise its base damage to 9 due to rounding."
