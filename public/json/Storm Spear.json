    "The <b>Storm Spear</b> is a desert-themed spear obtainable in pre-Hardmode. When thrust, it fires a Storm Spear Shot, a small bolt of electricity that deals 150% of the spear's base damage and inflicts half its knockback. It can be found in Sandstone Chests in the Underground Desert, as well as in Oasis and Mirage Crates.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
