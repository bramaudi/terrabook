    "The <b>Ghastly Glaive</b> is a Hardmode spear which is dropped by the Ogre mini-boss during the Old One's Army event. Unlike most spears, the Ghastly Glaive wobbles when swung, causing its head to \"slash\" across a semi-randomized width. Upon striking an enemy, a yellow dragon-head ghost appears next to a random nearby enemy and flies in a straight line through it, damaging all enemies it passes through before vanishing after one second.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
