{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Shrimpy Truffle","summaries":["The <b>Shrimpy Truffle</b> is a <linked>mount</linked>-summon item that spawns <b>Cute Fishron</b>, a miniature rideable <linked>Duke Fishron</linked>-style mount. The mount can fly and hover indefinitely. It is obtained from Duke Fishron's <linked>Treasure Bag</linked> in <linked>Expert Mode</linked>.","Cute Fishron has a base flight speed of 40 <linked>mph</linked>.","Moving through <linked>liquids</linked> causes Cute Fishron to gain a drastic movement speed bonus of about +105% (to 82 mph, the fastest of any <linked>mount</linked>), as well as providing the rider with a +15% damage bonus. These boosts continue for 6 seconds after it leaves liquid, though during this time its speed boost drops to +100% (to 80 mph).","Liquid boosts also take effect when Cute Fishron gets \"wet\" by flying in the <linked>rain</linked>, flying through <linked>Bubbles</linked> filled by liquids, splashes from a <linked>Water Bucket</linked>, or being hit by a <linked>Water Gun</linked>.","The +100% movement speed boost (80 mph) and +15% damage boost also take effect when the rider's <linked>health</linked> falls below half.","During contact with any <linked>blocks</linked>, Cute Fishron's movement speed is drastically lowered to a very slow crawl (5 mph, or 10 if boosted). This speed penalty is removed as soon as it loses contact with the blocks."],"statistics":{"Use time":"20 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Attracts a legendary creature which flourishes in water &amp; combat</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\"><linked>[img:Rarity level: Rainbow]</linked></span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"50000\"><span class=\"gc\">5</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
