    "The <b>Shrimpy Truffle</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>mount-summoning</linked> item that spawns <b>Cute Fishron</b>, a miniature rideable <linked>Duke Fishron</linked>-style mount that can fly and hover indefinitely. The Shrimpy Truffle is always dropped from <linked>Duke Fishron</linked>'s <linked>Treasure Bag</linked> in <linked>Expert Mode</linked>.",
    "Cute Fishron has a base flight speed of <abbr title=\"40 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 29.33 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">40 mph</span></abbr>. Moving through <linked>liquids</linked> causes Cute Fishron to gain a drastic movement speed bonus of about +105% (to <abbr title=\"82 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 60.13 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">82 mph</span></abbr>, the fastest of any <linked>mount</linked>), as well as providing the rider with a +15% damage bonus, indicated by Cute Fishron's eyes glowing. These boosts continue for 6 seconds after it leaves liquid, though during this time, its speed boost drops to +100% (to <abbr title=\"80 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 58.67 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">80 mph</span></abbr>). Liquid boosts also take effect when Cute Fishron gets \"wet\" by flying in the <linked>rain</linked>, flying through <linked>Bubbles</linked> filled with liquids, being submerged in liquid from a filled <linked>Bucket</linked>, or being hit by a <linked>Water Gun</linked>. The +100% movement speed boost (<abbr title=\"80 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 58.67 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">80 mph</span></abbr>) and +15% damage boost also take effect when the rider's <linked>health</linked> falls below half.",
    "Upon contact with any <linked>blocks</linked>, Cute Fishron's movement speed is drastically lowered to a very slow crawl (<abbr title=\"5 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 3.67 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">5 mph</span></abbr>, or <abbr title=\"10 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 7.33 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">10 mph</span></abbr> if boosted). This speed penalty is removed as soon as it loses contact with blocks."
