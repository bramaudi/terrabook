    "Once a high speed is reached, the Unicorn emits a sparkle effect, and from that point on, it will be able to damage enemies on contact. The invulnerability is granted for 1/10th of a second when the player and the Unicorn dash through an enemy, much like the brief invulnerability after taking damage."
