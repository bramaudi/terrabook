    "<b>The Undertaker</b> is one of the earliest obtainable guns, and is the Crimson's counterpart to the Corruption's Musket.

    "The Undertaker's stats are similar to that of the Flintlock Pistol, though with more damage and a slower rate of fire. <span class=\"eico i3 i5 i6\" title=\"Old-gen console, 3DS and Legacy tModLoader versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> Compared to the Musket, The Undertaker sells for half the price at <span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Gold Coin\" data-sort-value=\"10000\"><span class=\"gc\">1</span></span>.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Unreal</b>. One can also choose <b>Demonic</b> for damage and critical strike chance, <b>Rapid</b> for speed and velocity, or <b>Deadly</b> for a balance between the two."
