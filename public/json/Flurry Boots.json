When equipped, they allow the player to gain a speed boost after running for a certain distance continuously. Your speed will continue increasing until maximum speed is attained. At full sprint, they will increase your horizontal movement speed by about 40%. <i>(See <linked>Sprinting accessories</linked> for more information on the sprint effect.)</i>",
    "The Flurry Boots, <linked>Hermes Boots</linked>, <linked>Dunerider Boots</linked> and the <linked>Sailfish Boots</linked> have identical functionality, with their only differences being aesthetic (and being faster on <linked>Sand Blocks</linked>, in the case of the Dunerider Boots). In the case of the Flurry Boots, the user will leave a short dust trail under themselves as they run, which disappears immediately upon stopping, unlike the Hermes Boots.",
