    "The <b>Gelatinous Pillion</b> is a Hardmode mount-summoning item. When used, it summons a friendly <b>Winged Slime Mount</b>. Similar to the pre-Hardmode Slime Mount, the Winged Slime offers increased jump height, provides boosted movement speed, negates fall damage, and allows continuous auto-jump by holding the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Space Bar (PC default): Makes character jump\">↷ Jump</span></kbd></span> key. It also shares the Slime Mount's abilities to deal 40 summon damage to enemies when jumping on them from above, and floating when entering liquids.",
    "The Winged Slime Mount grants 2.66 seconds of flight time, similar to low-tier wings, allowing the player to fly up to a height of 73 tiles, as well as gliding while holding the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Space Bar (PC default): Makes character jump\">↷ Jump</span></kbd></span> key after flight time has been exhausted. It can also hover by holding <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"S (PC default)\">▼ Down</span></kbd></span>, similar to the Hoverboard.",
    "The Gelatinous Pillion has a <span class=\"chance\"><s>25*</s>1/4 (25%)</span> chance of being dropped by Queen Slime in Classic Mode, or a <span class=\"chance\"><s>50*</s>1/2 (50%)</span> chance of being found in Queen Slime's Treasure Bag."
