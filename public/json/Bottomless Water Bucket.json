    "The <b>Bottomless Water Bucket</b> is an item that functions similarly to the standard Water Bucket, the only differences being that it never needs refilling (and cannot be filled), it can be used an infinite number of times, has a slightly extended range, and can place water slightly faster than a standard bucket (especially when moving the cursor around while filling). It is one of the possible rewards from the Angler upon completing one of his fishing quests in Hardmode, with a <span class=\"chance\"><s>1.43*</s>1/70 (1.43%)</span> chance per quest after the 10th quest."
