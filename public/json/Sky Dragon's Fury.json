{"type":"weapons","title":"Sky Dragon's Fury","summaries":["The <b>Sky Dragon's Fury</b> is a Hardmode Melee weapon dropped by Betsy during the Old One's Army event. When left clicking, it spins in a 360-degree radius around the player, leaving behind an energy trail. Any enemy that comes into contact with the staff as it spins will take damage and get knocked back. However, when right-clicking, it begins to swing around in front of the player subtly, randomly shooting 3 projectiles which, after traveling a certain distance or coming into contact with any solid block or enemy, burst into damaging rings of electricity.","Its best modifier is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."],"statistics":{"Damage":"140 <span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i></span> / 70 <span class=\"eico s i6\" title=\"Legacy tModLoader version\"><b></b><i></i></span> <span class=\"small-bold\">(Melee)</span>","Knockback":"5 <span class=\"knockback\">(Average)</span>","Critical chance":"4%","Use time":"30 <span class=\"usetime\">(Average)</span>","Velocity":"24","Tooltip":"<i><span class=\"gameText\">Right click while holding for an alternate attack!</span></i>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 8]</span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"5 Gold Coins\" data-sort-value=\"50000\"><span class=\"gc\">5</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
