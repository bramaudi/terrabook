    "The <b>Sky Dragon's Fury</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Golem</linked> <linked>melee weapon</linked> that possesses two different modes of attack. When pressing the <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚒ Use / Attack</linked></span> button while it is held, the Sky Dragon's Fury spins in a 360-degree radius around the player while leaving behind a light blue energy trail, damaging and inflicting <linked>knockback</linked> to any <linked>enemy</linked> that comes into contact with the staff while it is spinning. When pressing the <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚷ Open / Activate</linked></span> button with the Sky Dragon's Fury, it fires three blue energy orbs in a spreading formation, which, after traveling a certain distance or upon contact with an enemy or solid tile, burst into damaging rings of electricity.
