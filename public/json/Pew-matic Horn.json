Bullets fired by this weapon quickly lose their horizontal speed once shot and are heavily affected by gravity. The type of bullet used does not change the projectiles fired by this weapon. Instead, the Pew-matic Horn will fire many random items. The damage dealt changes depending on the visual of the projectile being fired.",
