    "The <b>Reindeer Bells</b> are a Hardmode, post-Plantera mount summon item. It summons the rideable <b>Rudolph</b> character which greatly speeds a player's movement and adds the ability to fly. It has a chance of between 0.56% and 0.83% to be dropped by the Ice Queen during or after wave 15 of the Frost Moon event.",
    "Similar to the Hoverboard, flight height can be constrained by holding the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"S (PC default)\">▼ Down</span></kbd></span> key in addition to the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Space Bar (PC default): Makes character jump\">↷ Jump</span></kbd></span> key, so movement will be horizontal only."
