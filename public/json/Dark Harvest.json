    "The <b>Dark Harvest</b> is a Hardmode whip dropped by the Pumpking during the Pumpkin Moon event. Like other whips, it causes minions to focus on the last-struck enemy.",
    "Striking an enemy with Dark Harvest applies a \"dark energy\" aura to the target. Every time a minion attacks that enemy, the dark aura flares out and damages nearby enemies for 10 damage (not affected by any damage bonuses) with 50 armor penetration. The original target takes no additional damage.",
    "Hitting an enemy with Dark Harvest will grant the <b>Harvest Time</b> buff, which increases attack speed by 50% for 3 seconds, and the buff duration can be refreshed by hitting enemies with the Dark Harvest again.",
    "If the Dark Harvest hits multiple targets in a single attack, the damage dealt by each consecutive hit will be reduced by 10%.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>."
