    "The <b>Phantom Phoenix</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>bow</linked> dropped by the <linked>Ogre</linked> mini-<linked>boss</linked> during the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> <linked>event</linked>. It fires two arrows at a time, spreading randomly similarly to the <linked>Chlorophyte Shotbow</linked>, and also fires a large Phoenix projectile with a waving arc every third shot. The Phoenix projectile deals double base damage (64 base damage), can pierce an infinite amount of enemies (with a 5% damage penalty to the next hit for each enemy the projectile pierces), inflicts the <linked>Hellfire</linked> debuff, and explodes when colliding with a solid block. It also converts regular <linked>Wooden Arrows</linked> into <linked>Flaming Arrows</linked>, similar to the <linked>Molten Fury</linked>.",
    "Its best <linked>modifier</linked> is <b>Unreal</b>."
