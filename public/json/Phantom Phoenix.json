    "The <b>Phantom Phoenix</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked> <linked>bow</linked> that fires two arrows at a time, spreading randomly similarly to the <linked>Chlorophyte Shotbow</linked>, and also fires a large Phoenix projectile with a waving arc once per every third shot. The Phoenix projectile deals double the weapon's base damage (64 base damage), can pierce an infinite number of <linked>enemies</linked> (with a 5% damage penalty to the next hit for each enemy the projectile pierces), and explodes in a 6x6-tile rectangular area centered around the point of impact upon colliding with solid tiles. The Phantom Phoenix also converts regular <linked>Wooden Arrows</linked> into <linked>Flaming Arrows</linked>, similar to the <linked>Molten Fury</linked>, while the Phoenix projectile inflicts the <linked>Hellfire</linked> <linked>debuff</linked> for eight seconds to damaged enemies. The Phantom Phoenix is dropped by <linked>Ogres</linked> during the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> <linked>event</linked>, with a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"10\">1/10 (10%)</span> / <linked>1/5 (20%)</linked> chance during Tier 2, and a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"5\">1/20 (5%)</span> chance during Tier 3.",
