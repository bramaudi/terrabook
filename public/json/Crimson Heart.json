    "A <b>Crimson Heart</b> is a floating, pulsing, red, heart-shaped <linked>background object</linked> found deep in the branches of <linked>the Crimson</linked>. A world with Crimson features several Crimson Hearts, and destroying at least three of them (in a single world) is usually a crucial step in game advancement. This can be done using any <linked>hammer</linked> or <linked>explosives</linked>. Crimson Hearts release a fair amount of their own flickering light, similar to <linked>Crimson Altars</linked>. They are the Crimson counterpart to <linked>the Corruption</linked>'s <linked>Shadow Orbs</linked>.",
    "Crimson Hearts are usually located at the ends of the branches that split from the main circular room of a Crimson area, surrounded by <linked>Crimstone Blocks</linked>. In order to reach them, the player may use a <linked>Deathbringer Pickaxe</linked> or better pickaxe, explosives, or <linked>Purification Powder</linked>."
