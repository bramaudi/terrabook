A world with Crimson features several Crimson Hearts, and destroying at least three of them (in a single world) is usually a crucial step in game advancement. This can be done using any hammer or explosives. Crimson Hearts release a fair amount of their own flickering light, similar to Crimson Altars. They are the Crimson counterpart to the Corruption's Shadow Orbs.","Crimson Hearts are usually located at the ends of the branches that split from the main circular room of a Crimson area, surrounded by Crimstone Blocks. In order to reach them, the player may use a Deathbringer Pickaxe or better pickaxe, explosives, or Purification Powder."],"statistics":{"Max Life":"4 hits to destroy with a Wooden Hammer<br>Also destructible with explosives"},"crafts":{}}
