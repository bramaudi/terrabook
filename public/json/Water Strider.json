    "The <b>Water Strider</b> is a harmless <linked>critter</linked> that spawns on bodies of <linked>water</linked> on the <linked>Surface</linked> during the <linked>day</linked>. It only spawns near <linked>Sand</linked> or <linked>Jungle grass</linked> blocks, but not in the <linked>Ocean</linked> biome. It will not spawn if the <linked>wind</linked> speed exceeds 20 <abbr title=\"miles per hour\" class=\"nowrap\">mph</abbr>. <linked>Gold Water Striders</linked> have a <span class=\"chance\"><s>0.25*</s>1/400 (0.25%)</span> chance to spawn in place of the regular variant.",
    "The Water Strider moves by gliding on water and hopping around on land. Due to having only 5 health and no defense, it is often killed instantly by enemies or players.",
    "It can be caught with any <linked>Bug Net</linked> to be carried around in the <linked>inventory</linked> and released later, or crafted into a <linked>Water Strider Cage</linked> to be used as decorative <linked>furniture</linked>. Once crafted, the caged Water Strider cannot be released again, and when placed down it moves around inside the cage as it would do outside."
