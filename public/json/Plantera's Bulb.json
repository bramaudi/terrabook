{"type":"miscellaneous","title":"Plantera's Bulb","summaries":["<b>Plantera's Bulbs</b> are Hardmode background objects that will summon Plantera when broken. They are usually found naturally placed in random Underground Jungle locations, once all three of the mechanical bosses have been defeated (on Nintendo 3DS[img:Nintendo 3DS version] version, one suffices) – the status message <i>\"<span class=\"gameText\">The jungle grows restless...</span>\"</i> indicates that Plantera's Bulbs have begun spawning. On the [img:Desktop version] Desktop version, [img:Console version] Console version, and [img:Mobile version] Mobile version, one Plantera's Bulb will immediately spawn when all three mechanical bosses are defeated for the first time.","A Plantera's Bulb must be destroyed with a pickaxe, a drill, a block, a Clentaminator using any but the green solution, or with explosives in order to summon Plantera.","Plantera's Bulbs emit low light, and will appear on the minimap in pink in areas the player has already explored. They spawn one at a time after a delay of about half a day between them, and unless destroyed, several will eventually be present (10–15 in a large world's naturally generated Underground Jungle). If destroyed, they respawn after the same delay (though not necessarily in the same spot), allowing the player to summon Plantera an infinite number of times. Plantera's Bulbs will not appear on the Metal Detector or its upgrades."],"statistics":{"Placeable":"<span class=\"t-yes\">✔️</span> <span class=\"small-bold\">(2 wide × 2 high)</span>","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\">[img:Rarity level: 0]</span>"},"crafts":{}}
