    "The <b>Wither Beast</b> is an enemy from the Old One's Army event. When within 25 tiles of a player, it will surround itself with a 50Ã—50-tiles aura of crystals, visually similar to the Dryad's Blessing, inflicting the <b>Withered Armor</b> debuff, which halves defense. The debuff will dissipate immediately after leaving the aura zone. Eventually, the Wither Beast will enter a state where it will remain stationary until it is killed. It will also regenerate its health when damaged, healing at a rate of 25 / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\">50</abbr> / <abbr class=\"master\" title=\"Master Mode\">63</abbr> (in Tier 2) or 70 / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\">140</abbr> / <abbr class=\"master\" title=\"Master Mode\">178</abbr> (in Tier 3) health every second.",
