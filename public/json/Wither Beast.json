    "The <b>Wither Beast</b> is an enemy from the <linked>Old One's Army</linked> <linked>event</linked>. When within 25 tiles of a player, it will surround itself with a 50Ã—50-tiles aura of crystals, visually similar to the <linked>Dryad's Blessing</linked>, inflicting the <b>Withered Armor</b> <linked>debuff</linked>, which halves defense. The debuff will dissipate immediately after leaving the aura zone. Eventually, the Wither Beast will enter a state where it will remain stationary until it is killed. It will also regenerate its health when damaged, healing at a rate of 25 / <linked>50</linked> / <linked>63</linked> (in Tier 2) or 70 / <linked>140</linked> / <linked>178</linked> (in Tier 3) health every second.",
    "Along with the <linked>Etherian Lightning Bug</linked>, it is one of only two enemies in the event that require the usual 50 kills to receive the respective <linked>Banner</linked>."
