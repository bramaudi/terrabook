    "The <b>Thunder Zapper</b> is a Desert-themed magic weapon obtainable in pre-Hardmode. It is found in Sandstone Chests in the Underground Desert or in Oasis Crates obtained from fishing in the Oasis. When cast, it launches a fast-moving, non-piercing projectile that is unaffected by gravity and will disappear with a visual explosion that does no damage after traveling for about one second or when hitting a solid block. The projectile moves up and down in a randomized zig-zag pattern horizontally, but not vertically (traveling straight when shooting directly up or down).",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Mythical</b>."
