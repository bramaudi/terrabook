Flares cannot be recovered once they burn out.","When held, the muzzle of the Flare Gun will continually emit a flare effect, as long as at least one Flare is in the player's inventory.","The Flare Gun cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have <linked>modifiers</linked>."],"statistics":{"Uses ammo":"<linked>Flares</linked>","Damage":"2","Knockback":"0 <span class=\"knockback\">(No knockback)</span>","Use time":"18 <span class=\"usetime\">(Very fast)</span>","Velocity":"6","Rarity":"<span class=\"rarity\"><linked>[img:Rarity level: 1]</linked></span>","Sell":"<span class=\"coin\" title=\"1 Gold Coin\" data-sort-value=\"10000\"><span class=\"gc\">1</span></span>","Research":"<abbr class=\"journey\" title=\"Journey Mode\">1 required</abbr>"},"crafts":{}}
