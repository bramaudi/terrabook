    "The <b>Flare Gun</b> is a weapon that provides a ranged method of illuminating areas. It fires Flares, which provide light and stick to the blocks they hit. The Flare Gun is found randomly in Gold Chests underground.",
    "Flares travel in a slight arc and stick to blocks (similar to Sticky Glowsticks), but have greater velocity and range. They are waterproof, and can be fired into and out of water. Once fired, Flares emit low-level, flickering, tinted light  that lasts for 10 minutes. They stick to the blocks they impacted and will function underwater. Flares cannot be recovered once they burn out.",
    "When held, the muzzle of the Flare Gun will continually emit a flare effect, as long as at least one Flare is in the player's inventory.",
    "The Flare Gun cannot be reforged, and therefore cannot have modifiers."
