    "The <b>Portal Gun</b> is a Hardmode, post-Moon Lord tool which is always dropped by the Moon Lord. It launches projectiles capable of creating up to two portals (one fired by hitting <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Left Click (PC default): Use held item or attack\">⚒ Use / Attack</span></kbd></span>, the other by hitting <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Right Click (PC default): Activate environment object or talk to NPC\">⚷ Open / Activate</span></kbd></span>) upon impact with blocks. These two portals are linked; any player that touches one will be instantly transported to the other one, without losing momentum. While NPCs can be teleported with the Portal Gun, enemies or projectiles cannot.",
    "The Portal Gun has a maximum range of 675 blocks (1350 feet). It takes about two seconds for the projectile to travel this distance.",
    "While selected, the Portal Gun will alter the player's physics: their maximum fall speed is multiplied by 3.5 (from <abbr title=\"51 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 37.4 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">51 mph</span></abbr> to <abbr title=\"179 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 131.27 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">179 mph</span></abbr>) and horizontal momentum/inertia is kept while in the air. This effect is also applied if the last entity that affected the player's fall was a portal. The extremely fast movement may cause performance losses on some devices."
