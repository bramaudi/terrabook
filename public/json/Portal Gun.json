    "The <b>Portal Gun</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Moon Lord</linked> <linked>tool</linked> which is always dropped by the Moon Lord. It launches projectiles capable of creating up to two portals (one fired by hitting <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚒ Use / Attack</linked></span>, the other by hitting <span class=\"key\"><linked>⚷ Open / Activate</linked></span>) upon impact with <linked>blocks</linked>. These two portals are linked; any player that touches one will be instantly transported to the other one, without losing momentum. While <linked>NPCs</linked> can be teleported with the Portal Gun, <linked>enemies</linked> or projectiles cannot.",
    "The Portal Gun has a maximum range of 675 blocks (1350 feet). It takes about two seconds for the projectile to travel this distance.",
    "While selected, the Portal Gun will alter the player's physics: their maximum fall speed is multiplied by 3.5 (from <abbr title=\"51 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 37.4 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">51 mph</span></abbr> to <abbr title=\"179 miles per hour (as measured by the Stopwatch item) or 131.27 tiles per second\" class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"gameText\">179 mph</span></abbr>) and horizontal momentum/inertia is kept while in the air. This effect is also applied if the last entity that affected the player's fall was a portal. The extremely fast movement may cause performance losses on some devices."
