    "The <b>Boreal Wood Sword</b> is a broadsword crafted from Boreal Wood. It is similar to the Wooden Sword, but it deals 1 more damage and 1 more knockback, and has a lower use time. Because Snow biomes are usually not too far from the initial spawn point, a Boreal Wood Sword can be a superior alternative to its standard counterpart.",
    "The Boreal Wood Sword's damage is equivalent to that of a Copper Broadsword, though it would be wise to craft this instead due to how cheap it is to obtain.",
    "Its best modifier is <b>Legendary</b>."
