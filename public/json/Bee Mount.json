    "The <b>Honeyed Goggles</b> is a mount-summoning item that summons a friendly <b>Bee Mount</b> that the player can ride. It has a 5% / <abbr class=\"expert\" title=\"Expert Mode\">11%</abbr> chance to drop from Queen Bee.",
    "While the Bee Mount is slow on the ground, it is capable of flying and will greatly increase in speed while doing so. While flying, the player's vertical speed is kept constant. It can fly in the air for 10 seconds before it enters a \"tired\" state, during which it slows and glides down. The glide can be accelerated using the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"S (PC default)\">â–¼ Down</span></kbd></span> key. Afterwards, it requires a 3-second rest period on the ground in order to begin flying at full speed again. If the player takes off again immediately after landing an exhausted bee, it will fly, but much slower than usual. Its rest period is indicated by a \"heavy breathing\" animation that stops when the Bee Mount is fully recovered."
