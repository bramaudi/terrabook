    "The <b>Encumbering Stone</b> is a pre-Hardmode item that prevents item pickup while inside the character's inventory. It is sometimes found in Sandstone Chests in the Underground Desert.",
    "While in the inventory, the Encumbering Stone will prevent the pickup of any items, even if you already have a stackable item in your inventory. This can be very useful while farming events or mining out hellevators. The Encumbering Stone will also prevent the entry of items into Void Bags.",
    "Items reeled in from fishing are still placed in the player's inventory. Hearts and Stars will also be picked up even with the Encumbering Stone in the inventory.",
    "Pressing the <span class=\"key\"><kbd><span title=\"Right Click (PC default): Activate environment object or talk to NPC\">âš· Open / Activate</span></kbd></span> button on the Encumbering Stone will transform it into an <b>Uncumbering Stone</b>, allowing you to pick up items even while it is in your inventory. This allows you to easily toggle whether or not you want to pick up items."
