    "<b>Luminite Axes</b> are four tools. The four types are the <b>Solar Flare Axe</b>, <b>Vortex Axe</b>, <b>Nebula Axe</b>, and the <b>Stardust Axe</b>, each themed after a different Celestial Tower. They are all unable to be crafted, and instead the player must craft the Luminite Hamaxes. Even with Terrasavr and some other inventory editors, they seem to disappear, leaving an empty slot.",
    "Their best modifier is <b>Light</b> for harvesting purposes and <b>Legendary</b> for combat purposes."
