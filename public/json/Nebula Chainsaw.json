    "<b>Luminite Chainsaws</b> are four <linked>tools</linked>, all of which have the same stats. The four types are the <b>Solar Flare Chainsaw</b>, <b>Vortex Chainsaw</b>, <b>Nebula Chainsaw</b>, and the <b>Stardust Chainsaw</b>, each themed after different <linked>Celestial Pillars</linked>. They are all unable to be crafted, and instead the player must craft the <linked>Luminite Hamaxes</linked>.",
    "Like all axes and chainsaws, they are used to cut down trees, cacti, and giant glowing mushrooms, so the best possible modifier is <b>Godly</b>.",
    "With current methods, it is impossible to hack these items into a character's inventory using external editors, as they will disappear from that character's inventory as soon as they load into a world."
