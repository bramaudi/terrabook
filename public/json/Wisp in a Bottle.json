    "The <b>Wisp in a Bottle</b> is a <linked>Hardmode</linked>, post-<linked>Plantera</linked> <linked>light pet-summoning</linked> item that spawns a light-providing <b>Wisp</b> that follows the player around. While active, it is similar to the <linked>Flickerwick</linked>. The Wisp emits cyan light and is brighter and keeps better pace with the player than other light pets, except the <linked>Suspicious Looking Tentacle</linked> and <span class=\"eil\"><span><linked>Jewel of Light</linked></span><span class=\"eico s i1 i2 i4\" title=\"Desktop, Console and Mobile versions\"><b></b><i></i><span>(Desktop, Console and Mobile versions)</span></span></span> which have the same light radius. It moves in accordance with the direction keys the player is pressing, although it is oriented above the player's head by default. The Wisp's movement range appears to be about 7 tiles to the left, right, and below the player's hitbox and 7 tiles above the Wisp's normal starting position. The Wisp in a Bottle has a <span class=\"chance\" data-sort-value=\"0.25\">1/400 (0.25%)</span> / <linked>799/160000 (0.5%)</linked> chance of being dropped by <linked>Blue Armored Bones</linked>, <linked>Rusty Armored Bones</linked>, and <linked>Hell Armored Bones</linked>."
